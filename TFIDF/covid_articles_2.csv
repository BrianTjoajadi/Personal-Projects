1,College Student Makes Masks For The Deaf & Hard Of Hearing Community,https://designyoutrust.com/2020/04/college-student-makes-masks-for-the-deaf-hard-of-hearing-community/,"
gofundmeA college senior from Versailles, Woodford County, Kentucky, United States, put her stir-craziness to good use with a project that will help the deaf and hard of hearing community.Lawrence is a senior studying education for the deaf and hard of hearing at Eastern Kentucky University. Due to the virus, she is living back at home and doing her student teaching from home. After a conversation with her mom, they put their craft skills to work.“With the increasing concerns surrounding the COVID-19 health crisis in America, healthcare workers are desperately seeking PPE, which is in short supply. Many people have been pitching in and creating reusable fabric masks, which the CDC has deemed acceptable for use during these desperate times. However, a key group are excluded from this movement: the deaf and hard of hearing,” she writes on her GoFundMe page.More: GuFundMe h/t: lex18
lex18“As a college student studying Education for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, I have a great appreciation for the ways in which the world is designed with hearing people in mind. Those who rely on lip reading or ASL to communicate are often cut off from their source of communication when doctors and nurses don surgical masks. The solution seemed clear to me: just like there are fabric surgical masks being made, so too does there need to be masks made that are adapted for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Paper masks with clear pieces over the mouth already exist, but like the regular surgical masks, they are in short supply during this crisis. So I have modified the fabric mask pattern to be suitable for those who lip read or who rely on the facial expressions used when communicating in ASL to understand meaning and intention. I am distributing these masks to anyone who needs one, whether they are currently sick or not.”
lex18“Even though the CDC does not currently recommend those who are not sick wear masks in your daily life, if someone who needs these adaptive masks falls ill, they will have a mask to give to their doctor, so they can communicate more easily with each other. We are currently sending these out free of charge, and have set up this GoFundMe as a way to offset the costs of materials, shipping, etc. Any money we raise that is not used directly for these masks at the end of the crisis will be donated to Hands & Voices. Hands & Voices is a non-profit, parent-driven organization dedicated to supporting families of children who are deaf or hard of hearing.”

1,Researchers develop emergency ventilator based on resuscitation bags used in ambulances,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/researchers-develop-emergency-ventilator-based-on-resuscitation-bags-used-in-ambulances/,"The need for innovative solutions to address shortages in crucial medical equipment is greater than ever, and a new initiative from a global team of biomedical engineering experts is a perfect example. The team developed a way for resuscitation bags – common pieces of equipment carried by ambulances and paramedics around the world, and typically in strong supply at hospitals – to be repurposed as emergency ventilator hardware.Georgia Tech and Emory University biomedical engineering professor Susan Margulies, who is an expert in ventilator-associated lung injuries, said in a press release that while it is “heartwarming” to see US manufacturers open-source designs of existing FDA-approved fit-for-purpose ventilators, there’s a need still for a “simple, low-cost design” that can boost the numbers of usable equipment without requiring a manufacturing line spinning up.The device developed by the group of researchers adapts what’s called a “bag-valve-mask” or BVM for short, resulting in a piece of hardware the can simultaneously work for two patients at the same time. It can be made from stock sheet metal components and plastic gears, and works with common wall adapters or 12-volt car batteries for power sources, making them flexible for use in either permanent care facilities or temporary field hospitals.Basically, the modification works by squeezing the bags automatically and mechanically, whereas they’d normally be squeezed manually by a paramedic to revive a patient. The mechanized squeezing can continue for days, turning them into a workable (if emergency use only) ventilator for continuous care for COVID-19 patients, when no other ventilator hardware is available.This design is the result of a collaboration between Cranfield University in the UK, as well as Georgia Tech and Emory University. It’s already been prototyped, tested, and iterated upon, and the team behind the concept is now working to move the design to broader manufacturing in partnership with the Emory University Office of Technology.The potential of this design is significant in areas where access to resources and modern manufacturing equipment/supply sources for ventilators and other, more complex solutions being developed aren’t as abundant. That’s been flagged as a huge areas of concern by the World Health Organization, as the COVID-19 pandemic has hit developed countries hard, overtaxing even their advanced and well-resourced healthcare systems. Other nations with less mature health systems and fewer resources available to frontline care workers will need alternative solutions to address the crisis."
1,MIT researchers create a reusable silicone mask to replace the N95,https://www.fastcompany.com/90527995/mit-researchers-create-a-reusable-silicone-mask-to-replace-the-n95,"An award-winning team of journalists, designers, and videographers who tell brand stories through Fast Company's distinctive lensWhat’s next for hardware, software, and servicesOur annual guide to the businesses that matter the mostLeaders who are shaping the future of business in creative waysNew workplaces, new food sources, new medicine--even an entirely new economic systemCelebrating the best ideas in businessAs new coronavirus cases spike in the U.S.—Florida alone now has 12 times more cases than the entire country of Australia—healthcare workers still face a shortage of N95 masks. Many hospitals are now reusing the masks, even though they’re intended to be thrown out after a single use. Various solutions for disinfecting masks or increasing the supply are in the works, but a new silicone mask now in development is designed to be used and sterilized repeatedly, and could be as effective as the gold standard of an N95 respirator.“When the virus started popping up in the U.S., we talked about the need for PPE, and identified really early on that there was going to be a large deficit within the United States as well as the world,” says James Byrne, a radiation oncologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and research affiliate at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research who is part of a multidisciplinary team developing the new mask. “We really put our heads together to try to come up with something that was sustainable, and that’s how we really came up with this reusable, scalable, conformable, flexible mask.”[Photo: Courtesy of the Researchers]The team chose to use silicone rubber for the main part of the mask in part because of its durability—it’s the same material used in some baking equipment, and can easily withstand high temperatures. In a study of a prototype of the new mask, the researchers tested sterilizing it in an oven. They also tested a steam sterilization device and  by using bleach or rubbing alcohol. Nothing damaged the material. Because it can be sterilized in several different ways, it can be used anywhere. “We wanted to have a system that could be accessible and used by anyone globally,” says Giovanni Traverso, an MIT assistant professor of mechanical engineering and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, another member of the team.It’s also possible to quickly make huge volumes of silicone masks. “Having something that was scalable, meaning that we could relatively quickly make many to support a large population was critical,” Traverso says. “Injection molding of silicone is something that is recognized in the industry.” The material, which is already used in some anesthesia masks, is also comfortable and flexes to fit different faces; in a small test of a prototype with healthcare workers, around a quarter said that they preferred wearing it rather than a standard N95 mask. Because the material is clear, it can also make it easier to communicate with patients.Two breathing holes in the mask use small N95 filters that can be popped in and thrown out after each use. By using far less material, it should be possible to meet demand more quickly. It also reduces waste. But the researchers are also exploring the use of a different filter material that could be sterilized and reused.In tests with 20 healthcare workers, the team found that the mask could fit each individual correctly. They’re slightly tweaking the design based on feedback from the tests; one change involves slightly shifting the position of the filters so that it’s easier for patients to see the expression of the healthcare worker.The researchers are now also setting up a company to bring the masks to market, as they run the prototypes through the final tests that will be necessary to get FDA approval. They’re also beginning talks with the FDA about emergency use authorization, both for healthcare workers and the general public. For hospitals, the switch to reusable masks could save money. The team is currently running both an environmental impact study and a cost-effectiveness study, and has estimated that its mask could cost just $15 and be used up to 100 times, making the cost per use likely less than a quarter, with the filter inserts less than a dollar. “There is a potential significant savings compared to the standard disposable system,” Traverso says.Adele Peters is a staff writer at Fast Company who focuses on solutions to some of the world's largest problems, from climate change to homelessness.

1,U.S. researchers testing wearable tech to aid in coronavirus symptom detection - Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/6916704/researchers-wearable-tech-coronavirus-detection/,"Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.A group of researchers in the U.S. has developed a wearable device they say could detect symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus.The new device does not look like other wearable electronics — it’s soft, flexible and worn on the throat.

It measures respiratory activity and coughing, along with temperature and heart rate, said John Rogers, a professor of biomedical engineering at  Northwestern University who led the development of the technology.“The device measures basically motion — subtle vibratory signatures of underlying processes, body processes that appear at the surface of the skin. You can almost think of it as a stethoscope in a sense,” Rogers told Kelly Cutrara on Global News Radio 640 Toronto.“It’s capturing that type of information which allows us to categorize cough.”The device was developed in an engineering laboratory at Northwestern and uses custom algorithms generated by scientists at a Chicago rehabilitation hospital, the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.Initially, the gadget was developed to monitor swallowing and speaking functions in stroke survivors, but modifications have been made to capture possible COVID-related symptoms.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]The device remains experimental — it’s currently being worn by about 25 people including frontline health-care workers and some patients as part of a study.The devices are being produced at the lab at Northwestern, which can produce a maximum of about a hundred devices per week. Rogers said they would be listening to feedback from the medical community and potentially pursuing manufacturing partnerships if there’s interest to allow the device to be produced more widely.Rogers said the device could be useful in a few different contexts — monitoring those who work in high-risk contexts such as health-care workers, for example.“Sometimes I think individuals don’t really consciously realize that they’re beginning to cough more frequently or they’re beginning to develop, you know, early sign of a fever or their respiratory activity is becoming anomalous,” he said.

“And so this device allows you to kind of quantify all of that.”Another application would be for coronavirus patients to track the progression of their symptoms, including after they’re sent home from hospital.The device could also aid in scientific understanding of how the new illness progresses, Rogers said.The novel coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed an estimated 267,000 lives, has prompted a flurry of research around the world.In addition to research on testing, vaccines and antibodies, experts have also looked to develop technology in the fight against the virus.Contact-tracing apps have been designed to inform those who may have had contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, though the concept has prompted questions over privacy.A China-based start-up, Rokid, has developed a pair of glasses to help screen for symptoms.

While COVID-19 is above all a humanitarian crisis, businesses have also suffered as economies skid to a near halt. But already, there are signs of creative business building, as companies respond to the crisis with innovative solutions born of necessity. They are throwing out the old assumptions that govern how they do business, as they rethink how to interact with customers and employees, are required to build more resilient supply chains, and reexamine attitudes toward privacy and data sharing.That ability to envision new ways of operating will be crucial to weathering the crisis. Those that succeed will set the tone for the next normal that will follow and define the subsequent generation of paradigms for consumer and corporate behavior. These will become the operating structure for the next decade. Companies that hope to lead in this world should ask themselves some fundamental questions:These questions are second nature to disruptive business builders, who are used to overturning assumptions and innovating in the space left when an old assumption is removed. They know that a crisis of this scale brings seismic shifts, changing the expectations for business and creating new opportunities to innovate. They are formulating new solutions to both help resolve the crisis and reimagine their industries in the aftermath. We know there is no going back to the way things were. The goal now is to define the best possible next normal for when the crisis subsides. This article will look at some of the early solutions and outline concrete steps leaders can take to begin their own journeys.The extraordinary constraints and imperatives brought on by the COVID-19 crisis have rapidly thrust businesses into challenges they could never have envisioned. Many have had to innovate new capabilities for remote operation almost overnight, complete digital transformations in weeks rather than months or years, and launch new products in a matter of days. We believe the COVID-19 crisis will be a period of substantial business building and innovation. The earliest signs of this are already visible, including the following:All of these business builders recognize the world is changing and the rules are being rewritten. This is one of the most important elements of business building. Disrupters rethink assumptions to identify creative opportunities. Nondisruptors become, in effect, defenders of the old status quo.A crisis like the one we’re experiencing now is by definition unpredictable. We can’t know with certainty the duration or the severity, but we can begin to think about what the next normal might look like by inferring patterns from past crises.First, we know this crisis, like the ones that came before, will leave a lasting mark on the world. Not all the changes and innovations that business builders are introducing to the world now will stick, but many will, despite the fact that many would never have been considered pre-crisis. We will not go back to the old ways of doing things.Second, there is a pattern to the types of innovators that emerge from a crisis, linked to the types of assumptions that they overturn. Overturn an assumption, and the opportunities that emerge form the nucleus of a new company archetype for innovation.We have seen both of these phenomena before. From the global financial crisis, for example, assumptions about the use of assets and nature of ownership were radically overturned. Businesses became comfortable sharing assets and cocreating with customers and even competitors, and the sharing economy was born. From this archetype of “asset sharer” came some of the world’s most successful businesses, all launched in 2008–09, including Airbnb and Uber. A similar archetype emerged around the “gig economy,” which Uber also represented, along with Instacart, TaskRabbit, and others. Both these archetypes have persisted long after the financial crisis was resolved.Already, we can see companies, pushed by necessity, starting to overturn assumptions about the way organizations and consumers operate. Out of this, we have identified six early archetypes for post-crisis business builders:Challenging assumptions to identify ways to resolve the crisis and reimagine the future is just the first step that successful business builders take.Successful business builders also bring a different mindset to their operations. In a recent article, we described four activities that distinguish the best of this breed. These activities (summarized in the sidebar, “Four ways to succeed”) are true for business builders in all settings; today’s extraordinary circumstances are not an exception.For successful business building, agile ways of working are a given, but in the COVID-19 era they need to be adapted for remote working. Building the processes and communications to support agile dispersed teams takes both care and discipline. In a recent article, McKinsey described lessons learned from China on how to work remotely. The authors cite eight areas to focus on, ranging from structure, people, and culture to process control and communication efficiency, technology enablement, and cybersecurity.Many of these areas are second nature to business builders. Most successful business builders will be familiar with digitally enabled task management through tools such as Jira and Microsoft Planner. And many will use cloud-based tools for communicating, creating content, and sharing content.However, there are some places where business builders may face additional challenges from the need to work remotely. Best practices for adapting agile teams to dispersed workplaces include the following:These are real challenges, and best practices are being invented in real time. But as teams adapt and log successes, expect remote agile work to become an accepted part of the playbook.The capabilities described here emerged in a time of great need, as businesses found disruptive new ways to help protect lives and livelihoods amid the COVID-19 outbreak. However, once an assumption has been challenged, it is unlikely to reassert itself, even after the original crisis passes. Employees won’t settle for traditional office life once they’ve seen that they can work wherever and whenever works for them. The best companies will continue to seek the best talent, regardless of where they are located. Retailers will continue to find ways to humanize the digital experience.Learning from innovators and business builders is fundamental—not just for recovery from this crisis but for reinvention, again and again. Organizations that adapt to the archetypes that are emerging from this crisis and continue to overturn assumptions in search of new opportunities will emerge from this crisis with the greatest resilience and with the greatest opportunity to define a reimagined future.

1,Respirators From 3D Printers: How The Spanish Maker Community Fights Covid-19 From Their Living Rooms,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2020/03/23/respirators-from-3d-printers-how-the-spanish-maker-community-fights-covid-19-from-their-living-rooms/,"Open source innovators César García Sáez (top) and David Cuartiellies (right) created Coronavirus ... [+] Makers Forum.As hospitals prepare to take in more patients with the coronavirus, they are in acute need of life-saving equipment: ventilators that help patients breathe, face masks and protective gear. The problem is, there aren’t enough of them. And there’s not enough manufacturing capacity to easily hike up production. This is where the do-it-yourself (DIY) community in Spain comes in: Under the name Coronavirus Makers, over the last few weeks, thousands of citizens have been connecting online to fight against the shortage of life-saving equipment. From their living rooms and basements, they tinker with ideas and designs, share them, build prototypes and print them out with 3-D printers. Ashoka Fellow David Cuartielles and César García, both innovators in the open source space, are helping to curate the Coronavirus Makers Forum that they set up on March 13 as the crisis was getting worse. The Forum takes a bird’s eye view of all the community’s activities, connects members, extracts insights, and builds bridges to health care institutions and experts — to speed up solutions that could save lives. I caught up with them on Zoom to learn more. David, Cesar, thanks for making time available, I know it’s 9 pm in Europe!Cesar: Thanks, we still have another 2 hour phone call now, and then I will work through the night while David signs off and comes back online tomorrow morning.  Then I’ll try and catch some hours of sleep. We’re working around the clock.What have you been doing today? David: We’ve been in constant calls today. To give you an example, we had several conversations with doctors today who desperately need ventilators. Now, a ventilator is a very complicated machine. It’s impossible to 3-D print that in your basement. But it turns out there are a lot of patients in hospitals with milder symptoms. And they may be fine with simpler, mechanical ventilators. Doctors told us: Look, my ventilator has 100 parameters, but it will work fine for certain types of patients with just 5. Can you help me? And the answer is: Perhaps we can! Cesar: The maker community is working on these minimum viable products. One of our DIY-subgroups called reesistencia is progressing really fast on building such a respirator prototype. Who are members of your group?Cesar: There’s everyone — engineers, students, dads, moms, daughters, sons, people who work in companies, teachers, carpenters. It’s the open source maker community. Also doctors from places like Mexico and Argentina have joined to try to anticipate what’s coming to their countries. Spanish doctors don’t have the same amount of time right now, they are all working 24/7. David: All our community members have something in common: They are channeling their energy into making something positive. We’re under lockdown here in Spain, you can’t go out, so you might as well help in other ways to fight against the virus. The medical field is heavily regulated — but it seems you’re on purpose focused on hardware that is relatively simple to make, like masks or as you said mechanical ventilators.Cesar: Yes. Every group is self-organized to create something useful based on the feedback they get. When we learned that there could be a shortage of respirators in Spain, a group decided to tackle the challenge and start producing one. As the list of needs grew, other groups started exploring simpler open source devices, such as face masks. In this community, everyone is contributing and doing what they can to mitigate the crisis. What are you learning from your bird’s eye view?David: Right now, transportation is one big bottle neck. Because there’s a lockdown, we can’t just go out. You’ll get fined. Let’s say someone prints a face mask prototype in their house — how do they get it to the nurses and doctors, to get feedback for the next iteration? Some people have asked relatives who work in the hospital to take stuff along, but that can’t be it. We realized that in the city of Murcia alone, there are 120 people with 3D machinery, and they are ready to print. Regional groups have been created to organize the production and help thousands of people all over Spain, which is great, because we’ll need to print regionally. But we’ll need the data, and we’ll need to solve the transportation issue.What can be done? All this is happening so fast — you’ve been online doing this for just a little over one week! David: Yes, it’s happening super fast, and our job is to filter out all the relevant insights and learnings out of thousands of data sets that are inputted daily, and to connect people who are working on similar issues but have never talked to each other. Regarding transportation, we need help from UPS, TNT, to offer free transportation for the equipment that’s being produced. That’s very important.Are companies taking notice of what you do?David: Yes. And companies are also interested for business reasons. They don’t have time for R&D now, so they are calling in. They are looking for the R&D to come from our community, to eventually take it and scale it up to help.I’m assuming the likelihood for creative, out-of-the-box solutions coming from the DIY community is high.David: Yes. I think that we are really close to seeing some sort of unexpected side innovation, not necessarily on the ventilator side. For example, one member in one of the groups was saying: ""Given the nature of the virus, if you make a column of one meter high water with soap and if you filter the air through that column with bubbles, the virus might die.” And then others take this and experiment with it. Cesar: Because people are locked at home, they are pouring all their energy into this. People are so creative and collaborative across disciplines. For example, there’s this group working on face masks, and some are reading up on scientific papers and bringing that knowledge back to the group. We don't focus on news, we don't focus on politics. We focus on facts, science, and technologies that can solve problems. And hopefully this will help all of us to gain time while the curve of patients flattens, so we can avoid a pretty bad health system breakdown. Thanks to the collective effort, we think we can help this happen, and eventually save lives. David: Technology is a way to be useful and re-connect and work together in the most difficult times. ____You can follow David and Cesar’s work and other initiatives against Covid-19 on Twitter @AIRE_Covid19. David Cuartiellies is the co-founder of the hardware platform Arduino, one of the world’s leading platforms for DIY electronics.

1,Hospital Workers Are Making Their Own Face Masks Using Craft Supplies,https://gizmodo.com/hospital-workers-are-making-their-own-face-masks-using-1842391094,"Hospital workers in Washington state have started to make their own face masks from supplies they’ve purchased at craft stores, according to a new report from Seattle’s KOMO TV station. The DIY face masks are just the latest example of health workers around the world getting creative as they struggle with shortages of vital medical supplies during the covid-19 pandemic.Staff at Providence St. Joseph Health hospital volunteered and spent much of Tuesday constructing personal protective equipment (PPE), like face shields and surgical masks, from supplies bought at craft stores in the Seattle area. “These face shields offer protection from spray and splatter,” Jennifer Bayersdorfer, Chief Quality Officer at the hospital, told KOMO while demonstrating the homemade equipment.The state of Washington is one of the hardest-hit areas in the U.S., with the highest number of fatalities from covid-19, though New York state has more cases. Washington has at least 1,012 cases and 52 deaths, while New York has over 1,500 cases and 16 deaths. A stunning 27 of Washington’s deaths have been tied to a single nursing home, the Life Care Center in Kirkland, making it clear that personal protective equipment is vital to ensure the safety of both vulnerable patients and health care workers.The coronavirus pandemic has caused shortages for vital medical supplies worldwide, in everything from facemasks to ventilators, but many people online are trying to do whatever they can to mobilize DIY solutions.Some people have designed 3D-printed ventilators and posted the plans online, some of which can be made for as little as $100. Others are designing valves and other crucial components for the machines. And some hospitals in Italy, which are currently being inundated with covid-19 patients, are even getting help to actually 3D-print some of these parts, according to reports online.A 13-year-old girl in Japan has also drawn praise for making 612 homemade masks and donating them to the elderly and people in need, according to Japan’s Mainichi news outlet. The girl saved up her own money for the project, and spent 80,000 yen, roughly $740 US.The U.S. has at least 6,496 cases of covid-19 and 114 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker. And those numbers are only going to go up in the coming weeks, putting enormous stress on the health care system.The U.S. currently has about 160,000 ventilators, according to rough estimates from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, and an additional 12,700 in the national reserve. Needless to say, America will need a lot more in a very short period of time.People all over the world are likely to be locked down for the next 18 months if the infectious disease experts’ assessments are correct. But even as people lose their jobs, hopefully, we can mobilize the world to come together and support our health care workers however we can. Based on the photos we’re seeing in places like Italy, they’re going to need all the help they can get.Matt Novak is the editor of Gizmodo's Paleofuture blogI can’t express enough how much respect and gratitude I have for the front line medical and emergency response personnel, especially now, from the top doctors right down to the people who mop the floors at the hospital. These people are the real super heroes on the front lines of a war. If I had my way, they would be getting medals for bravery, and certainly they deserve them."
1,"Making 3D printed face shields, mask accessories and other coronavirus tools - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/news/making-3d-printed-face-mask-accessories-and-coronavirus-19-tools/,"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againA simple home 3D printer can make your homemade cloth mask more effective in fighting COVID-19.A homemade cloth face mask with a 3D printed clip. I had to go to the supermarket -- one of the only stores still open in the town I'm staying in during the coronavirus pandemic -- but my personal protective options weren't great. My mother, an accomplished quilter, crafter and creative type, had begun making cloth face masks on a borrowed high-end Bernina sewing machine, and since she was using leftover craft fabric, the designs and colors were at least bold. But the first batch had long fabric ties. They were OK but never felt especially secure, and they were nearly impossible to adjust without fully untying and retying the mask. For the second wave, she found some elastic to make ear loops, like on a surgical mask, but the elastic was thick and stiff, so what might be a perfectly sized ear loop for one person's ears didn't work on another. But other options were out there, and I don't mean ordering hard-to-find professional face masks. There's been a renewed interest in at-home 3D printing now that printers can be used for making simple COVID-19 safety gear. Large companies with dozens or even hundreds of professional-grade 3D printers are producing face shield parts and mask clips, as are small businesses with a handful of printers and even individuals with just a single device. And yet, despite being a prolific 3D printing hobbyist, I was left out on this new and helpful trend. The 3D printers I normally used were off-limits in the CNET Maker Lab in the basement of our shuttered office building. 3D printing a face shield, time-lapse-style. After a few weeks working remotely, I was able to get two new 3D printers delivered and immediately set them up to try producing home-made PPE materials. These were the Da Vinci Jr. 1.0 A Pro and the Da Vinci Mini W Plus, both from XYZprinting, a Taiwanese maker of popular entry-level 3D printers. The Mini W Plus is indeed entry-level (under $200) but out of the box only works with proprietary filament (there's a sold-separately NFC tag that opens it up to third-party printing materials. The Jr. 1.0 A  Pro model was a nice step up for $449, or $579 with both an optional hardened nozzle for specialty materials and a laser engraver (which I have not had a chance to try yet). I liked the large 5.9-by-5.9-inch print bed (150mm by 150mm), but again, using non-XYZ filament was a pain. I didn't need to jailbreak the printer, but I had to set my spool of AmazonBasics PLA filament up outside it, as it would not fit on the proprietary internal spool. You can read more of my hardware impressions of this and other cost-effective 3D printers here. A 3D printed clip for elastic face masks. My first prints were of simple hooks that worked with the elastic straps on many homemade cloth masks. Some people call them ""ear savers"" and there are dozens of different designs available on Thingiverse, Cults3D and other sites that host 3D printer files. The one I ended up liking best is located here. Glowforge, which makes an excellent lasercutter/engraver of the same name, has a program for making and distributing ear savers laser-cut from acrylic, with the needed files and instructions located here.  A new clip for cloth face mask straps. But elastic can be hard to come by, even Amazon is mostly out of stock. So the majority of masks being made at my kitchen table have long cloth straps. These two-part clips printed easily and attached securely to the cloth straps. Once secured, they made putting on and taking off a cloth mask very easy. The 3D printed top part of a face shield, with a clear plastic visor added. There are many designs for face shields, but all are essentially a headband with the ability to attach a clear plastic sheet to the front. These are home-made versions of the simple face shields often paired with paper masks in hospitals, and volunteers have been making them in large batches to share locally, as they print relatively quickly. Here's the specific model I liked best out of the handful I tried printing. Because of the tabs on the top brim, I was able to take clear plastic material and use a simple hole punch to attach it. A CAD file and 3D printed prototype for a door-opening, button-pressing tool. Another popular category is tools for opening doors, pressing buttons and other everyday tasks. Most look like small mountain-climbing hooks (or perhaps very elaborate bottle openers). The curved ends are good for long door handles, not so much for round door knobs, and many have pointers for operating ATM machines, elevator buttons and some kinds of touchscreens (pressure-sensitive resistive ones, not conductive capacitive screens). Some popular models can be found here and also here. I took a shot at making my own version, designed for maximum strength and utility. It's still a work in progress, but feel free to try it out here.  There are many organizations looking to help connect volunteers with organizations that need 3D-printed gear. For example, my colleague Rich Brown has been printing hands-free face shield ties for a volunteer group in Kentucky.

...Students of the M.AD School of Ideas are using their creative talents to help in their own way. When the M.AD School of Ideas shifted their term online, students participating in the Visual Impact course were tasked with conceptualizing real life, creative solutions to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The result: an assortment of innovative and impactful mask proposals that could help change the trajectory of the virus. Pippa Seichrist, M.AD School of Ideas founder and instructor of the course Visual Impact, found it imperative to focus her students' energy and time towards projects that could create change.“While the world hunts for a cure, we can do our part to support not only our healthcare heroes, but our world. And as creatives, we can play a unique role here. If we work together to harness the power of our creativity, we can produce ideas and solutions that have the potential to generate palpable change. The brief for this assignment was simple but critical. As masks become as common as gloves and socks, let us produce compelling masks that the world will want to wear, not just have to wear.”Students identified key demographics to target through their designs, and the results were immensely compelling. Vic Parizzotto, a first year student at M.AD School of Ideas, saw the importance of familiarizing children to the idea of wearing masks and created “FUN-MASKS”, a mask that is not only made and sized for children, but also functions as a “coloring book"" kids can draw on with washable markers. As many know, convincing children to put on their shoes can prove to be a near to impossible task, nonetheless convincing them to wear a facemask. However, by allowing them to customize their own mask the success rate could be raised in a creative yet practical way.“We’re FUN-MASKS! We’re simple and fun, cool but responsible. We are here to make safety and health exciting for everyone, join us and make the world a more conscious and creative place. Not all heroes wear capes, but all of them wear masks. #stopthespread.” Vic Parizzotto, Art Direction M.AD School of Ideas.Targeting a wildly different demographic, Austin Rettinhouse, a first year student at M.AD School of Ideas, took an important, yet comical and relatable, approach to his mask proposal. Feeling frustrated with the daily impacts of the virus, he developed “B!#*H Responsibly”“We are all on the same page: COVID-19 f@*king sucks. With some creative censorship, you too can share your endless complaints with those 6 feet or further. There’s never been a more appropriate time to b!#*h and moan, so strap on a mask and B!#*h Responsibly.” Austin Rettinhouse, Art Direction M.AD School of Ideas.Vic’s classmate Jean Lee, a first year student at M.AD School of Ideas, saw the negative impact the virus is having on culture. As an Art Direction major, the closure of all museums and galleries across the world was devastating. She wondered what the longevity of museums would be without ticket sales and feared the possibility of indefinite closure. As a result, she proposed MOD ART MASKS. The mask designs provide a fun new way for art enthusiasts to wear and promote modern art while staying safe. “Now more than ever, we would need the help of patrons so museum doors could remain open for future generations to enjoy modern art. Patrons can show their support for modern art by wearing MOD ART MASKS. MOD ART MASKS celebrate the art of Roy Lichtenstein, Henri Matisse, and Piet Mondrian. The masks reflect the aesthetic of Lichtenstein’s pop art influence, Henri Matisse’s terminal cut-out era, and Mondrian during the De Stjil movement.” Jean Lee, Art Direction M.AD School of Ideas.Design advertisement created by Miami Ad School, United States for COVID-19, within the categories: Agency Self-Promo, Public Interest, NGO.Incredible stock.

To make up for the global shortage of medical face masks caused by the coronavirus outbreak, workers in far-flung locations are taking matters into their own hands.People in Italy — one of the hardest-hit countries by the pandemic — as well as countries that have relatively few cases of the virus, like Jordan, Colombia, and Rwanda, are finding creative solutions to help people secure supplies. And in some cases, make a fashion statement.Jordanian designer Samia Alzakleh has been designing bedazzled face masks made with hundreds of Swarovski crystals each. She's sold 60 of the sparkling masks in two weeks.Jordan had 127 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of March 24. ""These are not 100% medical. I just wanted to encourage people to wear masks,""she told Reuters. ""And for people who like to follow fashion and the latest fashion trends, they can wear them.""

A world away in Soacha, Colombia, students at Julio Cesar Turbay school are also making their own masks in light of the shortage. They use materials like banana leaves, plastic bottles, and newspaper. Colombia had more than 300 confirmed cases of the virus as of March 24. Masks are especially scarce in the Bogota area, where air pollution runs high. ""As we are a population of limited resources, a vulnerable population here in the outskirts, our boys can't find the masks,"" Adriana Cubillos, a teacher at the school, told Reuters.""They are not being sold, and if they are sold, the prices are beyond our budget. That is the reason why we have decided to do this as a didactic element.""Masks are also hard to get in Rwanda, where 36 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed as of March 24.One tailor in the country's capital of Kigali, Alexander Nshimiyimana, has been making face masks out of traditional fabric called kitenge.""We are trying to protect ourselves to limit the infection of the people during this virus attack,"" he told Reuters.He sells his masks for 50 cents each — a fifth of the market price. Italians are also finding ways to innovate. With over 63,000 confirmed cases as of March 24, Italy is the worst-hit country after China.

Adolfo Lettieri, the owner of an upholstery business in Tuscany, turned to mask-making in response to soaring mask prices.""We started to make these masks out of anger, really, because when we tried to go and buy them, they were charging 15 euros a mask,"" Lettieri said. ""So I decided to make them and give them away for free because this overcharging is something I can't stand.""The team of volunteers makes 1,500 masks a day using upholstery fabrics. Around 100 people line up each afternoon to wait for a free mask.Healthcare workers around the world still lack access to these critical supplies. According to the World Health Organization, manufacturing of protective equipment would need to increase by 40% in order to meet current global demand. But Lettieri believes that providing homemade masks for local citizens is also useful.""I say, better this than nothing,"" he said. ""People turn up and they're using baking paper, shawls, or even scarves, so better my mask than that."" With their entire country on lockdown, Italians have been helping contain the outbreak any way they can.Maurizio Favilli, a retired tailor and a volunteer at Lettieri's business, said he's happy to put his skills to good use. ""I found out about his initiative and, given my experience, I wanted to make myself useful with the experience I've picked up, even if I am 80 years old,"" he said. ""I'm happy to be doing this.""Do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you'd like to share?

1,Chinese startup Rokid pitches COVID-19 detection glasses in U.S.,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/chinese-startup-rokid-pitches-covid-19-detection-glasses-in-u-s/,"Thermal imaging wearables used in China to detect COVID-19 symptoms could soon be deployed in the U.S.Hangzhou based AI startup Rokid is in talks with several companies to sell its T1 glasses in America, according to Rokid’s  U.S. Director Liang Guan.Rokid  is among a wave of Chinese companies creating technology to address the coronavirus pandemic, which has dealt a blow to the country’s economy. Per info Guan provided, Rokid’s T1 thermal glasses use an infrared sensor to detect the temperatures of up to 200 people within two minutes from as far as three meters. The devices carry a Qualcomm  CPU, 12 megapixel camera and offer augmented reality features — for hands free voice controls — to record live photos and videos.The Chinese startup (with a San Francisco office) plans B2B sales of its wearable devices in the U.S. to assist businesses, hospitals and law enforcement with COVID-19 detection, according to Guan.Rokid is also offering IoT and software solutions for facial recognition and data management, as part of its T1 packages.Image Credits: RokidThe company is working on deals with U.S. hospitals and local municipalities to deliver shipments of the smart glasses, but could not disclose names due to confidentiality agreements.One commercial venture that could use the thermal imaging wearables is California based e-commerce company Weee!.The online grocer is evaluating Rokid’s T1 glasses to monitor temperatures of its warehouse employees throughout the day, Weee!  founder Larry Liu confirmed to TechCrunch via email.On procedures, to manage those who exhibit COVID-19 related symptoms —  such as referring them for testing — that’s something for end-users to determine, according to Rokid. “The clients can do the follow-up action, such as giving them a mask or asking to work from home,” Guan said.The T1 glasses connect via USB and can be set up for IoT capabilities for commercial clients to sync to their own platforms. The product could capture the attention of U.S. regulators, who have become increasingly wary of Chinese tech firms’ handling of American citizen data. Rokid says it doesn’t collect info from the T1 glasses directly.“Regarding this module…we do not take any data to the cloud. For customers, privacy is very important to them. The data measurement is stored locally,” according to Guan.Image Credits: RokidFounded in 2014 by Eric Wong and Mingming Zhu, Rokid raised $100 million at the Series B level in 2018. The business focuses primarily on developing AI and AR tech for applications from manufacturing to gaming, but developed the T1 glasses in response to China’s COVID-19 outbreak.The goal was to provide businesses and authorities a thermal imaging detection tool that is wearable, compact, mobile and more effective than the common options.Large scanning stations, such as those used in airports, have drawbacks in not being easily portable and handheld devices — with infrared thermometers — pose risks.“You have to point them to people’s foreheads…you need to be really close, it’s not wearable and you’re not practicing social distancing to use those,” Guang said.Rokid pivoted to create the T1 glasses shortly after COVID-19 broke out in China in late 2019. Other Chinese tech startups that have joined the virus-fighting mission include face recognition giant SenseTime  — which has installed thermal imaging systems at railway stations across China — and its close rival Megvii, which has set up similar thermal solutions in supermarkets.On Rokid’s motivations, “At the time we thought something like this can really help the frontline people still working,” Guang said.The startup’s engineering team developed the T1 product in just under two months. In China, Rokid’s smart glasses have been used by national parks staff, in schools and by national authorities to screen for COVID-19 symptoms.Temperature detectors have their limitation, however, as research has shown that more than half of China’s COVID-19 patients did not have a fever when admitted to hospital.Source: Johns Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus Research CenterThe growth rate of China’s coronavirus cases — which peaked to 83,306 and led to 3,345 deaths — has declined and parts of the country have begun to reopen from lockdown. There is still debate, however, about the veracity of data coming out of China on COVID-19. That led to a row between the White House and World Health Organization, which ultimately saw President Trump halt U.S. contributions to the global body this week.As COVID-19 cases and related deaths continue to rise in the U.S., technological innovation will become central to the health response and finding some new normal for personal mobility and economic activity. That will certainly bring fresh facets to the common tech conundrums — namely measuring efficacy and balancing benefits with personal privacy.For its part, Rokid already has new features for its T1 thermal smart glasses in the works. The Chinese startup plans to upgrade the device to take multiple temperature readings simultaneously for up to four people at a time.“That’s not on the market yet, but we will release this very soon as an update,” said Rokid’s U.S. Director Liang Guan ."

We’ve seen Boston Dynamics‘ Spot robot walking, running, dancing, and opening doors. Now, the company has assigned it a more important task during the coronavirus pandemic: telemedicine.In this new solution, the iPad mounted on the robot lets health workers communicate with patients remotely, saving time, reducing exposure, and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE). The newly developed application is already under trial in Bringham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. [Read: Elon Musk’s 420th Starlink satellite is more than just a weed joke]Boston Dynamics said it’s open-sourcing this applications’ hardware and software design used for developers and robot-makers to develop solutions for  fighting coronavirus:We developed the payload, hardware, and software for this application so that they are generalizable and able to be deployed on other mobile robotic platforms with APIs and capacity for custom payloads.Today, we are sharing the results of our initial work deploying the robot with Bringham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts and we are open-sourcing the hardware and software designs used to get these robots into the field. Our hope is that these tools can enable developers and roboticists to rapidly deploy robots in order to reduce risks to medical staff.The firm is also exploring ways to measure body temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation remotely via Spot. It aims to gauge body temperature and respiratory rate through a thermal camera and pulse rate through an externally-mounted RGB camera.At later stages, the team wants to mount a disinfectant technology such as a UV-C light on the back of Spot to sanitizer patients and surfaces around the robot. This can be used in unstructured buildings such as a metro station or a hospital tent.You can check out design documents and the new application’s code here.

A shoemaker is producing face masks.A startup that makes phone booths as a quiet refuge in open-plan offices is now making coronavirus-testing booths for healthcare clinics.And it seems every 3D manufacturer backed by venture cash is firing up the printers to crank out personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.It's not unusual for a company whose business model isn't working to pivot in search of  more customers, or a steadier stream of cash, or traction in bigger markets. But these days, startups are facing a much different crisis, which no amount of planning or experience could have prepared them for. They must adapt.""It's almost like a wartime situation,"" said Chris Prucha, a founder whose startup Origin is using the 3D printers that it's unable to ship to customers to produce nasal swabs for COVID-19 testing.The coronavirus has been an accelerant for some startups looking to expand, or to create a new source of revenue. And even a temporary pivot can boost the company's public image for aiding in relief efforts.Semil Shah, a startup investor who focuses on early-stage companies, has been closely watching as startups shift parts of their production away from their core businesses to pursue other opportunities.Even before the pandemic, he said his advice to entrepreneurs has always been, ""if you're not No. 1 or No. 2, you're better off just selling the company or pivoting into something new because you don't really get paid to be third.""Athena Security is a two-year-old startup in the crowded business category of gun detection. It relies on machine learning to spot weapons in video surveillance images, but it can't identify a concealed firearm, as one of its better-funded rivals can. Now, Athena Security has shifted its focus to fever-detection systems.The technology relies on thermal cameras and software to pinpoint a person running a fever, which is a symptom of coronavirus infection.Athena Security's cofounder and chief executive officer Lisa Falzone said the company is rushing to fill orders at hospitals, banks, and other places where large numbers of people mill about. She said it's not hard to imagine that, someday, stores and restaurants will use the company's health surveillance system to help persuade house-bound customers to return.She said if a customer asks a restaurant host, ""Why should I come in here with a lot of people?"" the host could say, ""We wash our hands down more often. We clean the tables down. And also we have fever-detection system.""For some startups, the shift is more of a passing response to the pandemic than a permanent project.Carbon, a unicorn startup that develops 3D printing technology, has dedicated all of the machines at its Silicon Valley headquarters to producing face shields that protect doctors and nurses taking care of COVID-19 patients. The company is providing them to healthcare systems for free, with assistance from Adidas, a Carbon customer, said Ellen Kullman, chief executive officer of Carbon.""As long as the need for these supplies exists, we will continue production to help,"" Kullman said in an email.We wanted to find the startups that are changing what they work on because of the pandemic. We asked Shah's institutional seed-stage fund, Haystack, for tips, and researched on our own.These are the coolest pivots in tech since the start of the pandemic:Total funding: $12.3 millionWhat it does: Origin's business is focused on selling its 3D printers to materials manufacturers, which use the company's open-source software to develop new material chemistries, and test them faster than they did before. It also sells to customers making intricate parts for dentistry and automotive industry uses.How has the business changed:Origin was preparing to ship its third generation of printers from a warehouse in San Francisco when the city slammed into the pandemic. Employees under orders to work from home were unable to install the new units at customer sites. Rather than let the devices gather dust, Origin used them to print face shields, nasal swabs, and respirators.Each printer has the capacity to make 1,500 nasal swabs at a time, multiple times a day. Origin is on pace to supply more than 1 million swabs a week for hospitals and other testing centers by the beginning of May, said Origin's CEO Chris Prucha.In the next few weeks, ""we could supply enough swabs as a single company to conduct more tests than have been done to date over three months,"" Prucha said.The company's nasal swab has a soft plastic head, instead of a cotton tip. The head's lattice structure is designed to increase surface area and soak up a larger sample. It was shown to work as well as a standard swab in testing at a hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School.Total funding: $5.5 millionWhat it does: Athena Security makes software that allows security cameras to detect more than 300 types of firearms in real time, according to the startup.How has the business changed:Its software now applies the same rigor to detecting fevers as it does to spotting guns. Athena Security started selling systems that use thermal cameras to watch for an elevated temperature as people move through congested halls and doorways.The system sends an alert and a real-time video feed to the customer's security staff or monitoring system when it finds a person with a fever. It promises readings within a half-degree of accuracy. Athena Security's earliest customers include a hospital system, a bank, and a shared office space near its office in Austin, according to CEO Lisa Falzone.""The whole world is starting to realize right now that our greatest enemy is a virus,"" Falzone said. ""Let's put infrastructure in place that stops people (showing symptoms of COVID-19) from going into grocery stores. That's almost as deadly as a gun at the moment.""Total funding: $900,000What it does: Based in Sydney, Karst makes stationery without timber or water, using one of the most abundant materials on earth: calcium carbonate. The compound can be derived from rocks, and is used to make antacids.How has the business changed:The company, whose stylish notepads have been given as corporate gifts to Facebook and WeWork employees, started manufacturing bottles of hand sanitizer during the coronavirus outbreak. A 500-milliliter bottle costs about 14 US dollars, which is less than what some people are hawking Purell for on eBay, Craigslist, and Amazon.""The pre-coronavirus Karst would not have made hand sanitizer, but with the rule book thrown out of the window, we felt strongly compelled to look at things a bit differently,"" Jon Tse, a cofounder and co-CEO of Karst, said in an email.""Business is not as usual anymore. In this day and age where nothing is certain, more business owners could think about asking themselves why they shouldn't do something,"" Tse said.Total funding: $2 millionWhat it does: Room builds private, semi-soundproof phone booths for noisy, crowded offices. The New York startup has snagged clients of all sizes, including NASA, Nike, and Salesforce. How has the business changed:As the country began shifting into work-from-home mode, Room quickly realized that its office phone booths weren't in demand for the time being. The company said it quickly embarked on a ""one-week design sprint"" to reimagine its phone booth into something that could aid relief efforts. The company's so-called Test Booth uses upcycled doors from its phone booths and plexiglass walls, which are easily disinfected, to help shield healthcare workers from exposure to the virus. The booths also come fitted with medical-grade gloves and a shelf for disinfectants and testing equipment.Those units are now being shipped to medical facilities around the world, including hospitals in the UK, France, Mexico, and Canada. Room has also uploaded the booth's design to its website, so that other manufacturers can produce them.Total funding: $305,397What it does: Thalia, a small direct-to-consumer startup with less than $1 million in funding, used high-tech lasers to cut wood into guitar accessories and phone cases. The company's funding originally stemmed from a Kickstarter project launched by founder Chris Bradley in 2014.  How has the business changed:As a non-essential business, Thalia was originally set to shutter once the Bay Area announced its shelter-in-place regulations. Then Bradley's friend, a doctor, suggested that the company use its technology to design and build intubation boxes — reusable, clear boxes that sit over a COVID-19 patient's head. Their physician can place tubes into the patient's mouth and still lower the risk that coronavirus particles will escape and infect others.Within weeks, the company re-opened as an essential business. And its new healthcare operations might be here to stay, according to Bradley, who noted that the company had a chance to build from a base of 200,000 customers. ""This is a great business,"" Bradley told Business Insider in an email, referring to Thalia's line of phone cases and guitar accessories. ""But I expect that we will likely create a healthcare division that will continue to innovate and create new products for the new world that we live in. It seems that many things will change as a result of this pandemic and I can't imagine just reverting to the old ways."" Total funding: $682 millionWhat it does: Carbon invented a new method of 3D printing that it says could help companies make things that were previously unmakeable. Its machine ""grows"" objects out of a shallow pool of liquid resin using basic chemistry principles, inspired in part by the main antagonist from ""Terminator 2.""How has the business changed:The company has pivoted production at its facilities in California to focus exclusively on making face shields, part of its response to the dire shortage of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and first responders. It's donating face shields with financial support from a customer, Adidas.Carbon is also working with a medical device manufacturer to produce 3D-printed nasal swabs, which were validated in testing at a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.Carbon's CEO Ellen Kullman says the company will keep producing ""as long as the need for these supplies exists.""""This pivot in production at Carbon and across the industry has really shown the power of 3D printing and its ability to mitigate supply chain disruption,"" Kullman said in an email. ""Moving from manufacturing shoe midsoles and dental devices to face shields and nasal swabs in a matter of days is only possible with digital manufacturing.""Total funding: $131.5 millionWhat it does: Israeli startup Moovit's app helps users plan their trip routes across public and private transit options, like the train, subway, Uber, and bikes.The startup relies on data it collects from public transit agencies, as well as crowdsourced data from users, which helps it update the app's planned routes in real-time. It's available in 3,100 cities.How has the business changed:The coronavirus outbreak has caused city-wide travel and traffic to slump  across the world, creating logistical snags and financial troubles for public transit agencies, according to Moovit.But healthcare workers still need to move around cities to get to work, so the company rolled out a solution that lets corporations and public transit agencies deploy their unused vehicles where they're needed most. Frontline workers can use Moovit's app to schedule or request a ride on-demand.As cities grapple with reopening, the startup doesn't plan to wind down this new service anytime soon. ""It will be exciting to watch the future of urban mobility unfold when we slowly ease back into working from the office or going to school,"" Moovit said in a statement. ""Public transportation will always be that backbone of societal life, but it seems that there has been a wider path paved for On-Demand transit services to take on a greater role.""Total funding: $8.1 millionWhat it does: Atoms is the latest startup aiming to make the world's most comfortable shoes. Its sneakers come in quarter-sizes for a glass-slipper fit, while other manufacturers only have whole- and half-sizes.How has the business changed:The shoemaker now also makes copper-lined masks, which temporarily gives the masks anti-microbial properties, according to the Atoms website.The pivot was possible thanks to a longstanding relationship with Atoms' manufacturers in South Korea, which allowed the startup to pivot quickly. The company is selling the masks for $10 to cover the cost of production, and donates a mask for every one sold. Atoms said on its website that it doesn't expect to make a profit off the masks.Total funding: UndisclosedWhat it does: Meter is an industrial hardware startup originally from Somerville, Massachusetts. It has not yet publicly launched a flagship product.How has the business changed:Meter has developed a ventilator that's designed to be easily produced at scale. It's built from parts that can be sourced outside of the medical device supply chain. The components are made by using standard manufacturing processes like plastic injection molding and sheet metal construction. Now, the company is in talks with potential partners to produce them en masse.Meter's CEO Eduardo Torrealba said the team got started on the project after clinicians at Massachusetts General Hospital contacted one of Meter's engineers. The employee had worked on manual bag resuscitators during his doctoral studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the new ventilator builds on that research.Total funding: UndisclosedWhat it does: EO Products makes a range of organic personal care products, including shampoos, oils, bath salts and hand sanitizer. How has the business changed:Although EO Products already has a line 0f hand sanitizer products that dates back more than a decade, it has adjusted the operations of its production lines to boost its output in the wake of the coronavirus crisis — a move that the company deems especially necessary, given the nationwide shortage of sanitizer.EO Products said it added an extra manufacturing line and additional worker shifts, among other measures, in order to do so. ""We normally have seven production lines run in the company's factory, manufacturing everything from shampoo to deodorant,"" EO Products told Business Insider in an email.  Today, the company is narrowing its production mix to focus on goods that are ""all around keeping hands clean and healthy across our soap and sanitizer products."" Total funding: Undisclosed What it does: ESL Works helps train workers in the food-service industry to speak English on the job. It uses an app based on text messaging. How has the business changed: The startup has shifted from providing text-based English classes to delivering coronavirus safety training, a service that the company says is vital at this particular moment. It sends frontline workers a combination of coronavirus-related facts and multiple choice questions, to ensure that they stay informed about best practices needed to stay safe, medical symptoms to watch out for, and key facts about the virus itself. ESL Works has also broadened its target userbase beyond the foodservice industry. Now, companies in manufacturing, logistics, and a range of other industries can enlist ESL Works to help its frontline workers. ""As we all continue to learn more about the virus, accurate and accessible training for frontline workers will be just as important as an ample supply of PPE,"" Rachael Nemeth, ESL Works CEO, said in an email.Do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you'd like to share?

In particular, it’s calling for repair manuals for ventilators and BiPAP machines that can be used as ventilators. iFixit’s database can be found here, and the company is calling for people to create new device pages and upload photographs and manuals.The reasoning behind creating the database is simple: as the novel coronavirus spreads, the experience of Italian and Chinese hospitals suggests that the world’s supply of ventilators is going to be placed under huge stress, making it essential that these can be repaired quickly if and when they break down. This equipment will be an essential part of treating anyone who develops respiratory problems as a result of COVID-19.There are currently few sources for repair manuals online. iFixit notes that resources like Frank’s Hospital Workshop exist, but these are relatively small operations. Some manufacturers provide easy access to repair manuals on their websites, but others make them harder to find.There are a few different parts to iFixit’s campaign beyond assembling a collection of manuals. Once it’s got a manual, the company wants to format its information to make it as easy to understand as possible. It plans to break the manuals down into guides for individual repairs, to reformat them to make them more SEO-friendly, and to translate them into other languages.iFixit also wants to put together preventive maintenance guides so technicians can work to keep their equipment in good working order before it reaches the point of breaking down.As well as looking for people with access to repair information, iFixit is also asking for the medical community to provide information about which ventilators are currently in use as well as which parts are most likely to break. It’s an important and timely initiative from a company that’s usually associated with helping people fix their personal consumer electronics. If you’ve got access to any manuals that you think might be helpful for the initiative, you can upload them to iFixit directly or email the company if you’ve got a batch of manuals that would be too time-consuming to upload manually.A newsletter about computers"
1,Researchers to study if startupâ€™s wrist-worn wearable can detect early COVID-19 respiratory issues,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/researchers-to-study-if-startups-wrist-worn-wearable-can-detect-early-covid-19-respiratory-issues/,"It’s highly unlikely that the current coronavirus crisis will be neatly and fully “solved” by any one endeavor or solution, which makes new studies like one involving startup WHOOP’s wrist-worn fitness and health tracking wearable all the more important. The study, conducted by the Central Queensland University Australia (CQUniversity), in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, will employ data collected by WHOOP’s hardware from hundreds of volunteers who have self-identified as having contracted COVID-19 to study changes in their respiratory behavior over time.The data to be used for this study has been collected from WHOOP’s 3.0 hardware, which has also recently been validated by a University of Arizona external study conducted specifically to determine the accuracy of its measurement of respiratory rates during sleep, which the device uses to provide quality of sleep scores to its users. That study showed it to be among the most accurate measurement tools for respiratory rate short of invasive procedures, which is what has led researchers behind this new study to hypothesize that it could be valuable as a sort of early-warning system for detecting signs of abnormal respiratory behavior in COVID-19 patients before those symptoms are detectable by other means.The WHOOP team says that the respiratory rate its hardware reports very rarely deviates from an established individual baseline, and that when it does so, it’s usually due to either one of two causes: environmental factors, like unusually high temperatures or significant differences in oxygen concentration, or something happening within the body, like a lower-respiratory tract infection.COVID-19 is specifically a lower-respiratory tract infection, unlike the flu or a cold, which are upper-respiratory issues. That means there’s a strong correlation between rate changes due to lower-respiratory tract issues not accounted by environmental problems (which are relatively easy to cancel out) and instances of COVID-19. And because the WHOOP wearable is designed to look for deviations as a sign of distress, among the other sings it monitors, it could notice changes to respiratory rates relative to baselines before an individual becomes aware of any significant shortness of breath themselves.This is a study, so at this point that’s just a hypothesis, and will need to be backed up by data. The team behind it says it should take around six weeks, and there are an “initial several hundred self-reported COVID-19 cases” already present in the app from which it will begin, with a target of enrolling at least 500 individuals with positive COVID-19 test results. There are also other investigations underway to see if wearables that monitor a user’s health and fitness can provide early warning systems for potential COVID-19 cases, including a study being conducted by UCSF using the Oura Ring.Unlike with previous pandemics, the current coronavirus crisis comes at a time when we’re increasingly used to taking data-driven approaches to solving challenges, and when we also have a lot of self-quantifying health devices in circulation. Those could help us get a better grip on assessing the spread, as well as trends related to how it circulates and ebbs/grows within a population."

The single-panel test, which detects multiple types of infections, can help doctors diagnose patients and make decisions about treatment options. The test is available to patients through doctors, hospitals, and other authorized healthcare providers nationwide. LabCorp has also submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to offer the combined test through its Pixel by LabCorp™ at-home test collection kit, which would offer added convenience and accessibility.  “The U.S. is facing the most challenging health crisis in a century and is about to enter flu season, which has the potential to put additional strain on our healthcare system and cost lives,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; said Dr. Brian Caveney, chief medical officer and president of LabCorp Diagnostics. “Individuals infected with COVID-19, influenza A / B, or RSV, often experience similar symptoms of cough, fever, chest tightness, and body aches, providing a potential surge of patients seeking testing. Leveraging our scientific and technological expertise to simultaneously test for four major respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, will provide doctors a simple, efficient way to diagnose their patients.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;  LabCorp&CloseCurlyQuote;s COVID-19, influenza A / B, and RSV testing method is part of the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s continued commitment to meet the demand for diagnostic testing as the country addresses the overlap of the COVID-19 health crisis and flu season. Between October 1, 2019, and April 4, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were 39 to 56 million flu illnesses, resulting in 18 to 26 million medical visitsi. A significant flu and RSV season this year could put an added strain on the healthcare system, as people experience similar symptoms – fever, cough, and aches, for example – with COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.  Pending authorization by the FDA, the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test will be another convenient option for individuals to determine if they have the flu, COVID-19, or RSV. Thousands of people have used the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s COVID-19 Pixel by LabCorp at-home test kit, with 95 percent of users being very satisfied or satisfied with their experience. The Pixel by LabCorp at-home test uses a short swab that is easily inserted into the individual&CloseCurlyQuote;s lower nostril, reducing the discomfort associated with much longer swabs.  In addition to its novel respiratory flu test, LabCorp offers a suite of readily accessible prevention-to-detection solutions for COVID-19 and flu that doctors, healthcare providers, individuals, employers, and students can access. The company has performed over 13 million molecular tests since March, using several sample collection methods, including simple nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs.

A week ago, Dr. Matthew Abinante decided that his primary care practice should test for the novel coronavirus. Abinante runs Elevated Health, a direct primary care practice based in Huntington Beach, California. That means he charges patients a monthly fee for care and doesn't take insurance. On a typical day, his office isn't stocked with protective gear like N95 masks that are needed to take care of patients who have COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, he's set up a system where he is testing patients behind the loading dock of the office building where his practice is located. He runs out in gloves, mask, and white coat, patients open their car window, he collects the sample and runs back inside. As of Friday he'd done about 60 tests and had one confirmed positive. He's offering testing beyond his usual slate of patients to the entire community for a fee of $125. That includes a telephone visit to be sure the patient has reason to be tested. Not everyone is happy Abinante is doing the testing. His landlord told him to stop testing. And he was reported to the fire department, who came by to make sure everything was OK. ""I took an oath to do no harm, help patients at all cost,"" Abinante said. ""I felt like we were perfectly positioned to help."" For roughly 50% of the US population, primary care doctors are the first place they go to get their healthcare. Amid the coronavirus epidemic, doctors are faced with tough choices about how to care for patients — both those who are falling ill with COVID-19 and those they might otherwise see in a given week. Some are making the switch to seeing most patients online and test in-person, while some are opting to shut down entirely. Ultimately, the main goal is to keep people out of hospitals and emergency rooms, unless they really need to be there.""We created a mantra called, 'We want our patients healthy, happy, and at home',"" said Dr. Chris Chen, CEO of  ChenMed, a family-owned group of primary care clinics. Read more: A report that helped convince Trump to take coronavirus seriously projected that 2.2 million people could die in the US if we don't actTo do that, Miami-based ChenMed has decided to move more than 90% of the care it provides out of its 59 clinics. Instead, its caring for patients virtually or in their home, a decision the company made over the weekend. ChenMed manages the health of seniors 65 and older enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. Under the arrangements, plans pay ChenMed a set amount to keep their members healthy.ChenMed offers services like on-site pharmacies, transportation to and from appointments, exercise options, and social networking with other seniors.

But with COVID-19, there's recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for people 60 and older to stay at home as much as possible as the virus spreads. The population ChenMed serves is one that's particularly getting hit hard by the coronavirus, with the highest death rates reported. That makes congregating inside a clinic and in-person preventive visits too big of a risk. Chen said the organization began discussing what to do instead about a month ago.That includes providing for some of the necessities of staying inside.""I don't want seniors hunting for toilet paper,"" Chen said. Instead, the care teams ChenMed has on staff will take care of that for them.The drivers who used to bring patients in for visits will now deliver sterilized laptops and tablets to patients' homes so they can have remote visits. For now, ChenMed's population has only had a few confirmed cases of COVID-19. The patients have been tested through state health centers, as ChenMed currently doesn't have the ability to collect samples from patients. If they do, Chen said, the plan will be to bring the tests to patients' homes. ""We want them to remain socially distant,"" he said.Read more: Meet the 8 companies changing how doctors get paid and building the future of medicine.Dr. Clive Fields, the chief medical officer for primary care company VillageMD, who is based in Houston, started noticing patients were canceling appointments. Each of VillageMD's doctors manages the health of about 2,000 patients a year, including those with commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare plans.

To keep patients from canceling visits as well as triage patients concerned they might have coronavirus, VillageMD is moving most of their visits online, a service they had anticipated opening in July 2020.""We'll go from zero to a thousand visits a day over the first ten days,"" Fields said. Ideally, the move will keep patients at home and out of the emergency room. To help, VillageMD is keeping its clinics open and testing patients. In Houston, the clinics had two of the first six positive coronavirus patients in the area.""We're providing testing now at a less than optimum situation,"" Fields said. Read more: Hospitals are making protective gear out of office supplies and doctors are reusing face masks as supplies dwindle of crucial equipmentFields has been testing patients from within their cars, coming out to the parking lot, handing them a test through the window and then having them self-administer the test, which is inserted through the nose to reach the back of the nose and throat. It doesn't meet every requirement of how to safely and effectively administer tests, he said, but ""It's the best we got."" For patients who test positive for coronavirus, Field said, the hope is for VillageMD to manage it at home, monitoring symptoms and making sure patients are staying quarantined, until or if the patient's symptoms get worse and they need medical care at the hospital.

Tia, a women's health clinic that opened in 2019 in New York City, made the decision on Sunday to shut its clinic down indefinitely in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It'll still see patients via video and chat.""Like many other providers, we started saying, 'What is our role in all this,'"" Tia CEO Carolyn Witte told Business Insider.More than two weeks ago, patients started coming into the office worried about symptoms of COVID-19 and wanting testing. The clinic used swabs it had on hand and tried to send them to the state labs. The state wouldn't pick them up. By March 13, the clinic made the decision to stop doing in-person coronavirus assessments. By the following Sunday — the day hospitals in New York made the decision to cancel elective procedures — the organization decided to go all-virtual. That put patients and healthcare providers who would otherwise have to travel to the office at less risk as well as free up staff that did in-person clinical work to help out online with coronavirus assessments.Read more: 'We missed the mark': The inside story of the first weeks at buzzy startup Tia's clinic that aims to reinvent women's healthTia's virtual services before the pandemic were solely chat-based. In five days, Witte said, the startup built in video visits, which allows the office to prescribe new medications and more comprehensive visits. Changes the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced about payments for online visits are helping the organization make the transition. It's required additional training for the staff, who come from a gynecology background rather than internal medicine. As of Wednesday, there had been 50 Tia patients reporting symptoms, five of whom Tia routed to the emergency room to get tested. Some have been hospitalized, Witte said.

A few days ago, staff at a hospital in Italy realized they were running out of valves for patients' respirators, which are essential for the most serious cases of COVID-19, when patients are admitted to the ICU.The supplier wasn't able to provide them in the short term, as the company itself was facing a shortage caused by the outbreak. Italy has been hit incredibly hard, resulting in more than 2,500 deaths.The hospital, located outside Chiari in Lombardy, sent out a distress call through the newspaper Giornale di Brescia, which caught the attention of physicist Massimo Temporelli, founder of FabLab.FabLab is an Italian company that specializes in innovative manufacturing solutions. However, the restrictions on movement imposed in Italy prevented Temporelli himself — who is based in Milan — from handling the matter.After searching around, the physicist connected with startup Isinnova, which is based in Brescia — near Chiari, where the hospital is located — and has a 3D printer.Isinnova's Cristian Fracassi and Alessandro Ramaioli collaborated with Temporelli and began manufacturing valves in the space of 6 hours.In a Facebook post, Temporelli announced the moment the team managed to design a working valve which has now been used in the respiratory equipment of 10 admitted patients.Italy's Minister of Technological Innovation Paola Pisano acknowledged the achievement and congratulated those involved.Once the valves are determined to have met all the necessary standards for approval, the team hopes to produce them for all hospitals that need them.Do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you'd like to share?

The availability of protective masks has been on nearly everyone's mind as the novel coronavirus pandemic expands across the globe. And because N95 masks are often used only once, hospitals require a near-endless supply.In March, the National Science Foundation awarded a $200,000 Rapid Response Research grant to scientists at Northwestern University who are working on a self-sanitizing face mask that would deactivate viruses on contact. They're one of a dozen teams that received RAPID grants related to COVID-19, after Congress added $75 million to the program's budget for research related to the novel coronavirus.Led by Jiaxing Huang, materials professor at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, the scientists are developing an ""accessory"" embedded with virus-killing agents. It would attach to an existing mask and render virus particles inert before they make contact with the air.The device could be a sheet or sticker that could be wrapped or glued to the outside of a mask.

""Our main idea is to make an accessory loaded with well-known antiviral chemicals — such as acids and metal ions like copper — that can be stuck onto existing masks,"" Huang told Business Insider. ""To keep cost at a minimum, we want this to be a drop-in solution that would not disrupt current manufacturing.""While the insert could be used by healthcare workers who are sick, more likely it would be used by a patient: When they cough or exhale, the chemical sticker on their mask would theoretically neutralize virus particles before they were inhaled by staff.""If this works, it should make patients less infectious and help to cut down the source of spread,"" Huang said.The main obstacle, he added, is designing something that would only activate ""during exhale but not during inhale,"" because breathing in antibacterial chemicals could cause further health problems.The masks currently worn by patients still allow viral droplets to escape when they cough, sneeze, or even speak. N95 masks provide more protection for medical staff, but typically aren't worn by patients.The researchers want their new attachment to work with with any mask, which could significantly cut down the number required and potentially eliminate the need for N95 masks altogether. Right now shortages are so severe that some healthcare workers have turned to making their own or pleading for mask donations on social media.

Designated ""essential researchers"" during Illinois' shelter-in-place order, the team has been working nonstop on a solution. But it may be some time before the drop-in attachments find their way into hospitals.Huang said his lab is only developing a proof-of-concept ""to see if the loaded molecules are indeed released by exhaled droplets but not during inhalation."" And they're relying on simulating breathing, not human subjects. If those initial tests are successful, they'll work with a collaborator who can do COVID-19-related tests.He doesn't have a timeline yet for clinical trials, or for when the inserts might be tested specifically against the novel coronavirus. But he praised the NSF for funding promising research in the battle against pandemics.The goal, Huang said, is ""to rally researchers in physical science and engineering to proactively study these problems, formulate hypotheses, and design solutions."" "

A Seattle-area hospital system is asking volunteers to sew fabric masks to help make up for a shortage of protective gear during the novel coronavirus crisis.Providence St. Joseph Health – like many hospital systems are the country – has a critical shortage of N95 masks, the industry's standard for filtering out airborne diseases and has had to ask healthcare workers to reuse protective equipment.The hospital system is offering kits with materials to make 100 masks to volunteers in the Seattle area who know how to sew and have a sewing machine at home.""We need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely,"" reads a call on Providence's website. ""Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.""Providence will make kits available for pickup, beginning Monday at its hospital in Renton, Washington. While the effort is starting in Western Washington, Providence indicated it could expand to other areas.Asking volunteers to sew masks is the latest unusual step the hospital system has resorted to in order to cope with the shortage of protective gear.Providence administrators have used office materials to craft face masks and shields, a spokesperson told Business Insider, and healthcare workers and suppliers are driving protective gear between hospitals, once in the middle of the night.Providence has 51 hospitals. Washington state has had 1,376 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 74 deaths as of this writing.Do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you'd like to share?

Alphabet's life sciences arm Verily rolled out a screening tool — dubbed COVID-19 Pathfinder — to provide patients with answers to coronavirus-related questions concerning symptoms and health risk factors, according to FierceHealthcare. The tool was developed to help address the increasing demand for up-to-date coronavirus information while enabling health systems to focus on providing care. Pathfinder's content is sourced from public guidance provided by the CDC, WHO, and other public health authorities.

The move is Verily's latest response to the pandemic — and highlights how the life sciences titan is entrenching itself in several corners of the US healthcare ecosystem. In mid-March, Verily launched an online screening survey to triage individuals in the San Francisco Bay Area who were concerned they may have been infected with the novel coronavirus.Two weeks later, the life sciences giant erected four coronavirus testing sites across California that tested thousands of patients and released a set of guidelines to help government organizations, public health departments, and communities establish and scale similar drive-through testing locations. And with Verily previously linking up with Georgia-based Emory Healthcare to analyze medication and lab ordering patterns to create solutions that increase efficiency and cut costs, we wouldn't be surprised to see health systems increasingly look to Verily for tools that can help them more efficiently treat coronavirus patients.Pathfinder's ability to automate processes and streamline operations could prime Verily for new health system tie-ups that extend beyond the duration of the pandemic. Between Verily's litany of coronavirus-focused initiatives and work to streamline clinical research and accelerate drug discovery pre-coronavirus, the life sciences titan has branched out into diversified sectors of the US healthcare market that could help it differentiate itself from its competitors as a cutting-edge player in the space.Now, the firm has plans to expand the features and functionality of Pathfinder to enable more information sharing, symptom tracking, and workforce management — and we think the tech titan is in a prime position to land new partnerships with health systems looking to increase their operational efficiency while slashing their costs in the process.We think health systems would view tying up with Verily to integrate Pathfinder as an attractive proposition: With hospitals increasingly investing in triaging technologies to limit in-person interactions between frontline clinicians and patients, utilizing Pathfinder could enable health systems to efficiently triage and treat coronavirus patients should a second wave of the novel virus hit the US. And as health systems increasingly familiarize themselves with Verily's capabilities amid the pandemic, we think they'll be interested in tapping other solutions developed by the life sciences titan aimed at driving efficiencies and reducing costs post-coronavirus.Want to read more stories like this one?

But that's proving hard to do with limited protective equipment. A note written in marker on a box of procedure masks in Southern California hospital states that each staff member is allotted one mask for the entirety of their shift. At a Barcelona hospital, a lack of high-protection masks is leading to doctors and nurses stacking two less-protective surgical masks on top of one another. ""This thing blew up on us,"" Dr. Pelayo Pedrero, head of labor risk prevention at doctors' union AMYTS in Madrid, told Bloomberg. ""No one was ready for this. They didn't buy the supplies, they didn't prepare the hospitals to receive and treat all these patients. Not just in Madrid or Spain, but all over Europe.""In the US, different industries are volunteering their factories and production services to help make more equipment and protective gear for medical workers. Different hospital-set television shows including ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""The Resident,"" and ""The Good Doctor"" have announced that they're donating their stocks of supplies to actual working hospitals, according to The Hollywood Reporter and CNN. Read the original article on Insider"
1,This robot could make COVID-19 testing faster and safer - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/this-robot-could-make-covid-19-testing-faster-and-safer/,"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againAn automated system from Bright Machines could increase the number of coronavirus tests completed per day, and keep lab workers from contracting the virus.Bright Machines is developing an automated system that can test samples for coronavirus, without putting lab technicians at risk.Reliable, accurate COVID-19 testing is necessary for controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus and reopening the US. But the nation has faced a number of obstacles, including a shortage of tests and long wait times for results, due in part to the fact that most testing is done manually. And the process puts lab technicians at increased risk of contracting the virus. To speed up the testing process and protect lab workers, software and robotics company Bright Machines is leading an effort to develop a robotic system that can process COVID-19 test samples with little human involvement. Automating the lab testing process would also allow testing to be done 24/7, greatly increasing the volume of tests done per day, according to the company. ""I've been a part of projects where people think 'robots are trying to take my job,' but in this case it's really saving lives,"" said Hagai Bar, system engineer at Bright Machines. ""You're just replacing all that unnecessary manual work."" Keep track of the coronavirus pandemic.Bright Machines typically works with electronics manufacturers on ""microfactories"" -- combinations of hardware and software used to assemble and inspect products. The COVID-19 testing machine -- a collaboration with Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital Laboratory,  Impact Lab and iCobots -- uses standard Bright Machines building blocks: A robotic cell, a dual-conveyor, a robotic arm and a vision system. The robot is programmed to open the different-sized test tubes, drawing samples from the patient test tube to the control tube, and the vision system works to verify performance throughout the process, Bar said. The machine will soon be moved to Ichilov Hospital Laboratory. Once installed, it will likely take a few more weeks for it to be fully operational, Bar said. It'll provide the system at no cost for up to 12 months. A number of testing facilities around the world have also gotten in touch with the company about the solution, and those conversations are ongoing, he added. ""This project really highlights the importance of automation in manufacturing in general, and in the medical field specifically,"" Bar said. ""Redundant, risky manual labor is removed. And robots don't get tired and don't make mistakes -- testing labs can operate around the clock."" Bright Machines is also working with testing manufacturer Diagnostics for the Real World to automate the assembly of HIV test cartridges for its platform. With a microfactory, the diagnostics company plans to speed up cartridge assembly time from two minutes to 20 seconds per unit, and increase overall output from 100,000 units a year to 1 million units a year, according to a blog post.Automated solutions like these can be helpful for increasing the accessibility of testing and further reducing the risk of transmission, said Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, as well as the former Baltimore Health Commissioner.""At this time of unprecedented global health emergency, we need all hands on deck and all solutions that could improve testing availability and safety,"" Wen said.

1,Scientists find exquisitely potent antibodies; a blood test may identify who needs steroids - Reuters India,https://in.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-science-idINKCN24Q067,"Discover Thomson ReutersBy Nancy Lapid6 Min Read(Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.“Exquisitely” potent coronavirus antibodies foundScientists have found 19 potent antibodies that ""neutralize"" the new coronavirus, including nine that exhibit ""exquisite potency,"" according to a study published in Nature. Compared to previously isolated antibodies, some of the new ones can target different regions of the so-called spike that protrudes from the surface of the virus and helps it infect cells. ""Finding antibodies directed to different regions of the spike allows for more/better possibility of forming antibody cocktails to attach the virus and to avoid viral resistance,"" Dr. David Ho, Director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University, told Reuters. Furthermore, the newly found antibodies can be easily generated by the immune system, and potentially be used both to treat and prevent infection, he added. ""An antibody cocktail could be administered to infected patients early in the course of infection, especially if they are elderly or have underlying chronic conditions,"" Ho said, citing nursing home residents as an example. ""These folks generally do not mount a robust immune response to vaccines, hence antibodies might be an ideal approach."" (go.nature.com/2ZXZLeU)With precautions, newborns can stay with infected mothersA study of 120 babies born to mothers with COVID-19 found no cases of virus transmission during childbirth or after two weeks of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact, bolstering the case for newborns to stay with their mothers as long as safety precautions are observed. Early in the pandemic, some experts advised infected mothers to be temporarily separated from their newborns, but more recently the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics have said breastfeeding and room-sharing can be safe with appropriate precautions. In the new study, published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health on Thursday, the babies were kept in enclosed cribs except during feeding, and mothers wore surgical masks and followed frequent hand and breast washing procedures. ""We know that skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding are important both for mother-infant bonding and for long-term child health,"" co-author Dr. Patricia DeLaMora of Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian said in a news release. ""Our findings suggest that babies born to mothers with COVID-19 infection can still benefit from these safely, if appropriate infection control measures are followed."" (bit.ly/39oUCQk)Blood test may identify COVID-19 patients who need steroidsA blood test may help identify coronavirus patients who would benefit from steroids early in their illness, researchers said, after a gold-standard trial published last week showed dexamethasone reduced deaths in COVID-19 patients who needed oxygen or mechanical ventilation. In a report in the Journal of Hospital Medicine on Wednesday, doctors said two other widely available steroid drugs are also helpful. They studied more than 1,800 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 140 who were treated in the first 48 hours with dexamethasone, prednisone, or methylprednisolone. Overall, the steroids did not appear to reduce rates of mechanical ventilation or death. However, early steroid treatments in patients with high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in their blood - indicating high levels of inflammation - reduced the chance of mechanical ventilation by 80% and the risk of death by 77%. Using CRP levels to identify COVID-19 patients who might benefit from steroids is a potentially good idea, the doctors say. But to prove that, and also to see whether different steroids might yield different results, a randomized controlled trial is needed. (bit.ly/3jAORUv)COVID-19 viral loads similar in kids and adultsChildren and adults who had been ill with COVID-19 for a few days had similar amounts of the virus in their noses and throats, according to a study posted on medRxiv in advance of peer review. Coronavirus infections are less common and generally milder in children, but their role as COVID-19 carriers is as yet unclear. ""Overall, we cannot tell if children are as likely to infect others as adults, but at least from the amount of virus that is found in their upper respiratory tract, biologically it would be possible that they can infect others,"" said study leader Dr. Isabella Eckerle of the Geneva Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases. She noted that the amount of virus is only one factor among many that contribute to infectiousness, and the study only included sick children, whereas many infected children have no symptoms.

      Safety-net clinics reduce unnecessary visits to overwhelmed hospital emergency roomsWINSTON-SALEM, N.C., April 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- With coronavirus forcing many safety-net medical clinics across the country to curtail operations, North Carolina's free and charitable clinics have found new ways to continue treating the uninsured while keeping staff and patients safe – ultimately keeping thousands of patients out of hospital emergency departments.In a state with 1.3 million people who lack health insurance, 60 of North Carolina's 67 free and charitable medical clinics remain open, thanks largely to a new telemedicine program and the tenacity to bring it online in just two weeks.Now, North Carolina's safety-net clinics are gaining attention from other states and national leaders searching for ways to ""flatten the curve"" of the COVID-19 pandemic.""We feel a responsibility to keep our patients out of the state's hospital emergency rooms during this pandemic, and it was through sheer determination – and bravery – that our member clinics have managed to keep their doors open,"" said April Cook, board chair of the North Carolina Association of Free & Charitable Clinics (NCAFCC). ""Our challenge was to find a way to keep clinic staff and patients safe from those who might be infected – otherwise we'd have to close our doors.""Over two weeks in March, at no cost to the clinics, the NCAFCC secured and onboarded clinic staff to use a specially designed telemedicine program. Telemedicine allows medical personnel to engage in secure communications with patients outside the clinic through texting and video chats over phones and other devices.North Carolina clinics are using the technology to triage patients at home and in clinic parking lots to determine whether patients need to be seen at the clinic or another facility. Since March 16, the clinics have counted more than 3,500 patient encounters through telemedicine, including 2,300 medically related video chats with patients.North Carolina's free and charitable clinics treat more than 80,000 patients annually, providing primary and specialty care, pharmacy services, behavioral healthcare, dentistry and optometry – as well as social services such as food banks. Since the pandemic struck, patient visits are expected to climb as more workers lose their jobs and health insurance.""Telemedicine is like a silver bullet that not only has helped our member clinics stay on course delivering care but undoubtedly will also transform how our clinics – and medical providers everywhere – engage with patients going forward,"" said Randy Jordan, CEO of the NCAFCC.Jordan is getting phone calls from other states and recently heard from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). They're asking: How did North Carolina's clinics leap so quickly into telemedicine? His answer starts with a moment on March 12 when the first known COVID-19 patient walked into the Lake Norman Community Health Clinic in Huntersville, where NCAFCC chair April Cook serves as director.""We were on a video conference call with April and a dozen other North Carolina clinic leaders when she got word this possible COVID-19 patient was in the waiting room – and it was like the light bulb went off,"" Jordan said. ""We knew we had to act fast to protect our people and our patients – and also provide the care people need.""NCAFCC brought together a range of partners to launch the telemedicine program from design, to training, to securing protective masks for staff in the clinics. Financial and in-kind contributions from partners total more than $300,000 in annual support. Partners include: Dr. Andrew Barbash of The Apractis Clinic, Biogen Foundation, FaithHealthNC, Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust, North Carolina Baptist Assembly, and Updox, the telemedicine platform provider.About North Carolina Association of Free & Charitable Clinics The North Carolina Association of Free & Charitable Clinics is a private, nonprofit organization that provides advocacy, research, communications, resource development, training and technical assistance on behalf of its 67 clinic organizations and the people they serve. Our clinics provide life-changing access to quality healthcare and a voice for more than 80,000 uninsured patients in North Carolina.

Alibaba owns a third of Ant, which was also co-founded by Ma.Ram Parameswaran, Octahedron’s founder, expects Ant to resume its IPO and is holding onto Alibaba shares despite China’s unveiling of new anti-monopoly rules.“It’s one of the cheapest commerce businesses in the world if you use a reasonable sum-of-the-parts valuation framework,” Parameswaran said. “There’s lots of monetization runway in the core business with live streaming and recommendation engines.”Despite a slowdown, Alibaba’s revenue is still increasing at least 20% per quarter, while its cloud unit is on track to become profitable for the first time in the year through March. Its Cainiao delivery network is also expanding at its fastest pace on record, boosted by cross-border trade.Coronation CapitalThe Hong Kong-based family office bought more shares of Alibaba after they tumbled on Wednesday and is planning to increase total exposure to about 3% from 0.5% over time.“Alibaba is still going to be a trillion-dollar company in the future,” said founding partner Jin Zi, whose firm manages about $300 million of assets. “Yes, the company is going to come under pressure in the next three-to-five months, but we are investing for the next three-to-five years, and we don’t think other competitors can topple Alibaba.”Kamet CapitalThe family office has been trimming its position in Alibaba, which is one of its largest investments. But it’s still retaining some exposure because Alibaba is highly correlated to a rebounding Chinese economy.The firm’s next moves will depend on how China’s recovery holds up and how policy makers implement the new anti-monopoly rules, said Kerry Goh, the firm’s Singapore-based chief investment officer.“Alibaba will be under pressure,” Goh said. “We want to see how the regulatory pressure balances out the economic recovery.”Commonwealth Avenue Asset ManagementThe macro-oriented investor has confidence that Chinese regulators know what they’re doing and that Ant will likely list within a year from now, albeit at a lower valuation.“Alibaba will still get benefits from the listing,” said Chong Sze King, the firm’s managing director in Singapore. “We think it’s a good time to buy.”Long Corridor Asset ManagementThe Hong Kong-based hedge fund, which oversees about $200 million, boosted its Alibaba position by one-third after the Ant IPO was pulled, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is private.Ali Sheikh, Long Corridor’s chief operating officer, declined to comment.(Updates with Alibaba share price in first and second graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman had his best trade of all-time earlier this year when he bet against the market, and he's  placing a similar bet again despite the market optimism surrounding the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.What Happened: Business Insider reports that Bill Ackman placed a new hedge against the market Monday.The news came on the same day Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) announced a 90% efficacy rate for their COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The desire to know where you land in the sea of retirement savers…It’s been said that gridlock is a feature, not a bug, of the US Constitution, and we may be about to find that out. The election results have left some questions to be resolved, but a few things are coming clear: Democrat Joe Biden is the winner of the Presidential race, but down ballot, the Republicans appear to have made important gains. We’re looking at the prospect of divided government – a Biden Administration with a Republican Senate and a Democratic House with a stronger minority. According to JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, this may be the best possible outcome.“A GOP senate majority should ensure that Trump’s pro-business policies stay intact, and if Biden is confirmed we should be able to expect an easing of the trade war, which should boost global trade and corporate earnings growth,” Kolanovic noted.With investor fears allayed – that the Democrats would roll back Trump-era tax policy or focus on aggressive bureaucratic regulation – Kolanovic believes the markets are primed for gains.However, finding the right stock to buy is always a challenge, even in a bullish environment, but TipRanks offers investors the range of metrics necessary to sort through the raw data of the markets and bring those nuggets to light. These include the analyst consensus rating, the upside potential, and the Smart Score; each gives a data point for investors, and taken together, when they all align, they’ll make a powerful signal.The analyst consensus is just that – an average derived from full range of analyst ratings. The upside potential comes from the stock’s collected price targets; it’s a mathematical average that suggests the stock’s possible growth on a one-year time horizon. And the Smart Score uses known predictive factors of market success to give stocks a score that points toward forward performance. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three stocks that check all three of these boxes. Pacific Ethanol (PEIX)We’ll start with a diversified company, with production lines in food products and animal feeds as well as industrial alcohols and renewable fuels. Pacific Ethanol sells its products on the global market, and has seen major gains in 2Q20. Even with recent losses in account, the stock is up a whopping 795% this year.The gains have come since July, as the company expanded production in response to demand for sanitizing alcohols. Sales of alcohol for hand sanitizers has been a major boost for the Pacific Ethanol in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Taking new production and sales potential into account, the company has revised 2020 earnings estimates upward to the $66 million to $86 million range.So far, the company is on track. Like many small-cap manufacturers, Pacific Ethanol was running earnings deficits prior to this year – but COVID-19 changed that. Earnings turned positive in Q2 and remained so in Q3. The sudden shift has investors bullish on the stock.Amit Dayal, 5-star analyst with H.C. Wainwright, sees plenty of reason for an upbeat outlook here. “Investors should note that management indicated that though the company has a firm visibility on pricing, specialty alcohol volumes delivered to customers could vary on a quarterly basis. Given that sanitizers are a key end-market for specialty alcohols, the stock has come under some pressure with positive COVID-19 vaccine related news. However, we believe demand for sanitizer products should remain elevated with increase in any economic activity in the near term. We believe the improved balance sheet and cash flow is allowing the company to make investments in areas of the business that have been previously overlooked, and may have been under-contributing as a result,” Dayal opined.In-line with these comments, Dayal rates this stock a Buy along with a $16 price target. This figure suggests an impressive 174% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here)All three of the recent reviews on PEIX are positive, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. PEIX shares are priced at $5.82 and have been growing fast in 2H20, but the Street expects to see more growth here; the average price target is $16.50, implying 183% growth ahead for Pacific Ethanol. (See PEIX stock analysis on TipRanks)New York Times Company (NYT)Our next stock is a storied name in the publishing world. The New York Times company owns its eponymous newspaper, along with an array of other media assets and Times-related brands. The company boasts a $6.4 billion market cap and upwards of 30 business assets. Its core brands attract 150 million readers every month, and over 6.5 million paid subscriptions.In a news environment as fast-paced and chaotic as 2020 has been, the NYT has reaped the benefit of people’s need to know. The stock is up 20% year-to-date, despite some slips in recent weeks.Covering NYT for J.P. Morgan, analyst Alexia Quadrani writes, “NYT remains our favorite midcap stock, and we see the growth story for digital subs continuing and will very likely reach 10m well ahead of management’s 2025 target. ARPU and margin improvements over time will also make the stock look cheaper on earnings, which will negate the pushback on valuation.

(See NYT stock analysis on TipRanks)Thor Industries (THO)Last but not least is Thor Industries, a major manufacturer of recreational vehicles. RVs are a popular form of leisure, and have seen a modest gain during the ‘corona time,’ as there are compatible with social distancing requirements while still permitting households to vacation together. Thor owns seven brands, including well-known names like Airstream and Heartland. The company has a $4.8 billion market cap and upwards of $8 billion in annual revenues.Quarterly revenues, which were reported for Q3 earlier this month, have recovered from a short dip earlier this year. The Q3 top line came in at $2.32 billion, the highest of the past four quarters. Earnings, which has been falling since Q3 of last year, showed a massive sequential spike, jumping from 43 cents per share to $2.14. Leisure stocks have been seeing a resurgence recently, and BMO Capital analyst Gerrick Johnson has been reviewing the sector. Of Thor Industries, Johnson writes, “Stocks of leisure companies usually move higher or lower on retail sales results more so than revenues or EPS. We think investor focus will shift after this quarter. Retail has caught up with investor expectations… We think … Thor (THO) will have the longest legs in terms of consumer demand…” Turning to sales numbers, Johnson adds, “Last quarter, management sounded very optimistic about FY2021 and expects the current robust retail and restocking cycle will last through at least the end of its fiscal year.”To this end, Johnson rates THO an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $110 price target implies an upside of 26% from current levels. (To watch Johnson’s track record, click here)Once again, we are looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating; Thor has 4 recent Buy reviews. The stock also has a $115 average price target, which suggests a bullish 32% upside for the next 12 months.

If the fund is owned inside a tax-favored account like an IRA or retirement account, the sale will not generate a taxable gain.Plug Power (PLUG) is a strange sort of business. In more than 20 years of operation, the hydrogen fuel cell company has sold a lot of fuel cell systems, but never earned a profit, and never generated positive free cash flow. Instead, Plug funds its operations mainly by issuing and selling new shares -- over and over again. In fact, from 2000 to 2020, Plug's share count has grown from 4.4 million to 399.7 million -- i.e. grown 90x in size.But what a difference a pandemic makes, and what a difference (the hope for) a Green New Deal!As COVID-19 unhinged stock markets from ordinary rules for valuation, and the prospect of a Democratic ""Blue Wave"" showering taxpayer dollars all over the renewable energy industry, Plug Power stock has gone on a tear. Shares of the fuel cell company are up more than 5x from their price at the start of the year, and now trade at nearly 22 times trailing sales, and 34 times book value, despite a total lack of profitability.This doesn't concern H.C Wainwright's Amit Dayal, however. In a note published following Plug's Q3 2020 earnings results, the analyst argues that Plug Power's valuation is really all about the future -- a future as far off as 2024... or even 2030.Plug Power, you see, may not be earning profits right now. But Plug management has repeatedly promised in recent quarters (and repeated the promise on Monday) that in 2024 it will earn $200 million in operating profit and record ""gross billings"" of $1.2 billion.Now, ""gross billings"" aren't a financial metric often recited by publicly traded companies. To translate the term into something more familiar to investors, therefore, Dayal calculates that Plug's revenues in 2024 will be about $1.1 billion -- more than four times the company's trailing revenues currently. Dayal further projects that by 2030, Plug will grow this number even further -- to $7.4 billion in annual sales. And if this number is correct, says Dayal, the company will achieve a 10-year compounded revenue growth rate in excess of 38%.That's a staggering sum, but in fact, it's not entirely unrealistic. In fact, over the past five years alone, Plug has grown its revenues at about a 29% compounded rate. While acceleration to 38% certainly won't be easy, Plug's history of revenue growth suggests it does lie within the realm of possibility.And yet, that's not really the point, is it? The point of a profit-seeking venture like Plug should in theory be not just to ""sell stuff,"" but to earn profits from selling stuff -- and it's here that Plug Power has historically fallen short. In Q3 2020 for example, Plug grew its sales 80% (so twice as fast as Dayal's projected sales growth rate). Problem was, the company also doubled its net loss on those sales, from $18.2 million a year ago, to $39.4 million in Q3.Despite this huge Q3 loss, and despite Plug's unbroken history of similar losses, Dayal insists that Plug's rapid sales growth will eventually bring the company to profitability -- indeed, he projects net profits by 2023, which is even sooner than Plug is promising. With this prospect in mind, he has reiterated his ""buy"" rating on Plug Power stock, and doubled his price target $30. (To watch Dayal's track record, click here)All in all, Plug's strong share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the consensus price target. Shares are selling for $23, and the average target of $20.89 implies a 9% downside. Paradoxically, the stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys and no Holds or Sells.

1,Arts Club theatre being turned into 'field hospital' for new COVID-19 equipment,https://vancouversun.com/news/arts-club-theatre-being-turned-into-field-hospital-for-new-covid-19-equipment,"COSMIC stands for Collective Open Source Medical Innovations for COVID-19.A Vancouver theatre is about to be transformed into a showcase for innovative medical equipment developed in Canada to fight COVID-19.Among the products is a ventilator that can be built with locally sourced materials anywhere in the world for under $500. The new gravity-based ventilator is meant to address a shortage of ventilators that are critical for saving the lives of patients with acute COVID-19.A kind of “field hospital” to demonstrate new products to fight COVID-19 is being built in the Arts Club by Olympic Village over the next four weeks.Dr. Christopher Nguan said COSMIC Medical has grown since February into a multi-disciplinary and collaborative group of more than 130 scientists, doctors, medical students, engineers, physicists, and designers.“We’re open-source, non-profit, everything is on the table. We’re fully transparent,” said Nguan, a kidney transplant surgeon at Vancouver General Hospital and associate professor at the University of B.C.“All we’re interested in is making an impact on COVID. Whatever it takes for us to do that, that’s what we want to do.”COSMIC stands for Collective Open Source Medical Innovations for COVID-19. Nguan is one of three co-leads along with Alexander Waslen, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student at UBC, and Philip Edgcumbe, a medical student at UBC and biomedical engineer.The group’s first success is gVent. Invented in six weeks, it is a low-cost ventilator that two people can build in three hours. A ventilator helps a seriously ill patient breathe when he or she can’t do so on their own.Traditional low-cost ventilators are between $5,000 and $50,000, and uses technology to blow or compress air to deliver it to a patient.But Chase Crisfield, a Rossland resident and medical student at the University of B.C., had a new idea for a ventilator.“When I saw some of the other designs,” Crisfield said in a video about gVent, “I felt they lacked a physiological mechanism behind them. I wanted to develop something that was gentle on the lungs, knowing how fragile and inflamed the lung tissue can be when someone is sick.”Nguan said gVent’s unique design doesn’t use a compressor or blower.“We have an inverted piston with a water seal. It’s kind of like having a water bottle with the bottom cut off and you squish it down into a bucket of water. That head of pressure you generate by pushing the bottle down and trapped air inside the bottle is the air that goes to the patient.”The gVent’s simple design, he said, makes it ideal for making it quickly in disaster situations and for fighting COVID-19 in developing countries in Latin America and Africa where traditional ventilators are in short supply.COSMIC Medical’s ventilator was awarded $100,000 as top prize in Roche Canada COVID-19 Innovation Challenge, beating out more than 840 applicants.COSMIC Medical has a functioning, patented ventilator and is awaiting Health Canada approval, a process that could take until August.But the group isn’t waiting. Nguan said COSMIC Medical will be publishing designs online as soon as they work out how to protect the group and its volunteers from any legal liability. He expects that to happen within a few weeks.Other COVID-19 products the group is developing include a snorkel mask and bubble helmet.Nguan said COSMIC Medical will be using Studio A in the Arts Club to show how its products work together in a hospital setting. As well, it will provide a place for COSMIC Medical volunteers to physically meet in one space. As a co-founder, Nguan said he has only met five people physically and 30 people remotely via Zoom.He also plans for the theatre to be a venue where other local groups can bring their COVID-19 medical designs and prototypes and see which ones are best.“Everybody wants to make a difference,” he said about COSMIC Medical volunteers. “We’re only in it for the benefit of patients and health-care providers.”kevingriffin@postmedia.comSign up to receive daily headline news from the Vancouver Sun, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.There was an error, please provide a valid email address.A welcome email is on its way.

MATT BARNARD/Tulsa WorldLupe Chairez prepares an HVAC unit for transport to a temporary hospital in New York from the AAON factory in Tulsa on Thursday, April 2, 2020. MATT BARNARD/Tulsa WorldA Tulsa manufacturing company is providing equipment for a temporary hospital in the New York City area, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.AAON, which makes large-scale heating and cooling units, is building 2,200 tons of HVAC apparatus for the Stony Brook Temporary Hospital. Stony Brook is on the north shore of Long Island, just east of New York City.More than 1,300 people have died from COVID-19 in New York City, which is struggling to find hospital space to care for the critically ill.AAON is making the equipment around the clock to ensure that the units arrive in New York by Tuesday. The first truckload of these units was scheduled to leave Tulsa on Thursday afternoon, with the balance of the equipment to be shipped by this weekend.The 2,200 tons of HVAC apparatus equates to the cooling capacity for more than 700 single-family homes.A principal from AAON’s sales office in New York City called AAON President Gary Fields on Sunday to inquire about the company’s ability to meet the hospital’s need.After details were ironed out, an order was placed for 44 of the 50-ton customized HVAC units for the Stony Brook temporary facility.Founded in 1988, AAON is a leader in the industry.The company earned business from all over the country, including for the Nike headquarters in Oregon and for a $1 billion expansion of New York City’s Javits Center.The firm last year built a $35 million research and development center named after AAON founder Norman Asbjornson.Gallery: See what these Tulsans are doing to ease the stress of the pandemicAt first, all Erica Parker wanted to do was brighten a neighbor’s day.One of the nearby residents in Parker’s south Tulsa neighborhood is a woman in her 90s, whose family — out of very real concerns for her health in the face of COVID-19 — was adamant about the woman sheltering in place.“They really didn’t want her going outside at all,” Parker said. “Maybe out on to the front porch, but that was it.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.One New York hospital system is looking to acquire its own supply company after tough lessons learned amid the coronavirus pandemic.Staff at Northwell Health turned to hardware stores for garden hoses amid equipment shortages to make use out of ventilators received from the state, the New York Post reported, citing “Leading Through a Pandemic,” a book written by Michael Dowling, president and CEO at Northwell Health.Joseph Kemp, a spokesperson for Northwell Health, confirmed to Fox News on Monday that The Post gave an accurate account of Dowling’s comments in his upcoming book.CORONAVIRUS CASES JUMP 40% IN US KIDS LAST MONTH: REPORTThe hospital's reported consideration to acquire its own supply company is an attempt to step away from an overreliance on foreign companies to manufacture “vital supplies,” including pharmaceutical drugs, the outlet wrote, citing Dowling.“We’re in talks with a couple of companies. You can’t depend on people overseas for supplies when you are in the middle of a war,” Dowling told The Post on Sunday. Officials told the outlet ""they have been exploring the possibility since May, with ongoing discussions with private manufacturers,"" per the report.The new book was co-authored by Charles Kenney, Northwell Health’s chief journalist, and is said to be the ""first major book"" by health care providers who worked on the front line as the virus ravaged through the city.The book also mentions how staff used 3D-printed parts to create “makeshift breathing machines and nasal swabs” for virus tests, the outlet wrote.Other than plans to better equipment supply, the book also made additional recommendations in preparation for any future health-related disasters, such as accelerating telehealthcare.CLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS APPStay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

1,Doctors seek new solutions for helping seriously ill Covid-19 patients,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/doctors-seek-new-solutions-for-helping-seriously-ill-covid-19-patients-1.4235156,"About 15 per cent of Covid-19 patients will require hospitalisation, and 5 per cent will need to be admitted to ICU.Your Web Browser may be out of date. If you are using Internet Explorer 9, 10 or 11 our Audio player will not work properly. For a better experience use Google Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge.
    “The single most important thing we have done is to restrict population movement and introduce social distancing early. This bought Ireland’s healthcare system extra time in preparing for this pandemic, especially relative to the UK,” respiratory consultant Oisin O’Connell stresses.However, even when serious cases occur, doctors increasingly have a variety of treatment options as their understanding of the disease, and international learning on it, broadens.“We expect the disease to come in waves, and with each wave we want to be able to have learned from previous ones,” O’Connell says.About 15 per cent of patients will require hospitalisation, and 5 per cent will need to be admitted to ICU. In countries where systems were overloaded, over half of the ICU patients have died but Irish figures could be better if we can remain within our surge capacity.“Patients are referred to the ICU because they fail to maintain adequate levels of oxygen in their blood despite having an oxygen mask,” explains Dr Michael O’Dwyer, head of critical care at St Vincent’s Hospital.These patients then require mechanical ventilation in an ICU. “Our experience is that patients with Covid-19 coming to an ICU require a period of 7-14 days, at least, on a ventilator before their lung function improves substantially.”While many patients improve with this standard treatment, given the vast numbers involved researchers have been searching for additional treatments to shorten the length of the disease and improve death rates.“Whilst most of the motivation in this field is altruistic, undoubtedly financial gain and academic progression also plays a role,” O’Dwyer cautions.Doctors have learned Covid-19 can manifest itself in different ways among different groups of seriously ill patients. Many patients will show the classic signs of oxygen depletion known as “hypoxia” and respiratory distress associated with various subtypes of pneumonitis, which are a form of inflammatory condition of the lung tissue. They are increasingly recognising patients can display several patterns of pneumonitis.Furthermore, doctors are learning therapies may have to vary according to the different “phenotypes”, or patterns, the disease displays in individual patients, according to O’Connell. Many of these therapies will be undergoing international trials that Ireland hopes to join such as the World Health Organisation-endorsed “Solidarity” trial, but due to the international emergency specific therapies are also being used in a more limited fashion in medical settings across the world.While the peer review of research is being expedited, O’Dwyer says a potential downside is the administration of treatments “that have no real beneficial effects but do have poorly understood detrimental effects”.“It also makes robust randomised trials more difficult to perform because all patients want the widely advertised cure (despite the lack of evidence and potential for harm) and are therefore unwilling to participate when they may end up in the placebo arm of a trial.”“There simply cannot be any trade-off in standards for drug development and testing,” says Dr Liz O’Brien, chief medical officer of Befins Healthcare and a former pharmaceutical regulator. “These rules are there for a reason. You pose a real risk to society if you lower standards and put something out that millions of people could be exposed to.”Nonetheless, doctors continue to search for new options, while drug companies are researching products that could prove highly lucrative. Some of these drugs are new, and others are existing drugs for which new uses are being tested.Remdesivir, an anti-viral tried out during the Ebola epidemic, is the drug that has attracted most attention, not hindered by the way very limited – and positive – results of a trial were leaked last week. For specific patients, Tocilizumab, traditionally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, can be repurposed to decrease an extreme inflammatory response. “In some patients, it may be beneficial if introduced at the right time, and in the right context,” O’Connell says.Another approach tried in China for some patients with a poor immune function is a form of immunoglobulin therapy involving the use of pooled plasma from recovered patients to treat seriously ill patients.“This could prove beneficial, but it needs to be done in an evidence-based setting, with proper monitoring for side-effects,” he says. The recently established National Research Ethics Committee for Covid-19 is providing supports for expedited study and clinical trials in this context.Other seriously ill Covid-19 patients have developed tiny lung clots (known as micro-thrombi) which can cause local damage either in the lungs or other areas of the body. There are several international research studies examining blood thinners and clot-busting medications for some of these patients.Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, traditionally used to treat malaria and lupus respectively, as well as the antibiotic azithromycin, are being studied internationally also, but they may pose a serious risk of heart arrhythmia.Beyond individual treatments, scientists have observed that genetic factors may predispose particular patients – such as those with high blood pressure, obesity and other genetic innate immunity factors – to the disease. O’Dwyer’s view is that there are lots of “interesting” potential treatments available but they remain experimental because of the lack of good trial data.“Because of this we should be much more aggressive in enrolling patients into trials so that we expedite the process of generating useful information.”He urges caution about advocating treatment outside of a trial because of the potential for harm. “Our best treatment option today is high-quality supportive ICU care in a well-resourced environment whilst participating in the ongoing clinical trials where these are available.”Most hopes are pinned on a vaccine, of which many prototypes are currently in development. But it may take years for a vaccine to be properly tested and even then, virus mutation could pose a further challenge.O’Brien says it may be that that “there is no solution to the virus other than supportive therapy, societal changes and ‘taking the hit’.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak Subscribe.

And it won't get any easier,' Cantrell said in a statement. 'That is why weeks ago I convened a Death Care Task Force to engage funeral home directors, coroners, cemetery directors, hospital officials, faith-based leaders and other stakeholders. 'They are working to ensure that this process is respectful but also mindful of the regulations we must follow to ensure safety for all involved in this somber process.' The announcement came as the number of New Orleanians infected with COVID-19 climbed to 5,070 on Wednesday, including at least 208 deaths. New Orleans has formed a 'death care task force' to ensure safe handling and burial of coronavirus victims as the city battles one of the nation's highest fatality rates (file photo)Mayor LaToya Cantrell (pictured) announced the task force on Tuesday, along with a grim set of new safety guidelines for managing, preparing and burying COVID-19 victimsCantrell said New Orleans is following official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for processing human remains that might contain COVID-19 because the virus can travel postmortem.  Officials handling the bodies are required to wear an N95 mask, eye protection such as a face shield and goggles, double surgical gloves and an impervious gown with full sleeve coverage.  Coroners and funeral home staff must wipe down each body with antiseptic solution and follow other strict rules regarding body bags when transporting the remains.  The guidelines also stipulate that bodies should be buried within three to five days after death to reduce back-ups in funeral homes.   The 'death care task force' was convened to ensure that the guidelines are followed to the letter as New Orleans braces for an expected influx of people dying from coronavirus.  'We'd like to thank Mayor Cantrell for her leadership in gathering all of the key stakeholders, not just in New Orleans but across the region so that we can work collaboratively to inform our residents on the best practices during this outbreak,' the task force said in a statement.New Orleans is following official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for processing human remains that might contain COVID-19 because the virus can travel postmortem. Anyone handling bodies is required to wear extensive personal protective gearDr Gerry Cvitanovitch, the coroner for Jefferson Parish, was one of the officials named to the task force, according to The Times-Picayune. He told the outlet that it was put together so leaders could agree to a regional approach for how to deal with the sudden influx in bodies.  Cvitanovitch on Sunday said that he'd rented a refrigerated truck to free up body storage in hospitals because some funeral home directors and drivers didn't have proper personal protective equipment until recently, and therefore couldn't handle remains.  He said some directors were still reluctant to take in coronavirus victims - while others at larger funeral homes scramble to keep up with demand for services.  EMS personnel bring a patient into Ochsner Baptist Medical Center in New Orleans Cantrell's announcement on Tuesday also included new regulations for funerals.Services will be limited to immediate family based on social distancing guidelines which restrict the size of gatherings.   Because bodies will need to be processed within five days of death, families have been urged to plan small funerals prior to burial and schedule larger ones for a later date. The mayor's office recommended that loved ones use social platforms and live-streaming technology if they want to include people outside of the immediate family in funeral events. A field hospital for COVID-19 patients was set up inside the Ernest N Morial Convention CenterStaff work inside the Morial Convention Center as they prepare for coronavirus patients New Orleans remains one of the main hotspots for coronavirus in the US, which has seen more than 435,500 cases and at least 14,831 deaths as of Wednesday. Figures released last week found that the Big Easy's death rate - 37.93 per 100,000 people - is more than double the rate in the US epicenter of New York City, which is 18.86, according to University of Louisiana at Lafayette economics professor Gary Wagner. Obesity has been cited as a possible explanation for higher than average per-capita COVID-19 death rates in New Orleans.   Nearly 40 percent of residents have high blood pressure, 36 percent are obese and about 19 percent have diabetes - higher rates than the general population. Louisiana has recorded more than 17,000 cases and at least 652 deaths to date. New Orleans remains one of the main hotspots for coronavirus in the US, which has seen more than 422,000 cases and at least 14,297 deaths as of Wednesday

Qventus technologies are helping health systems meet immediate COVID-19 challenges and prepare for post-COVID resource strains
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Qventus, the leader in AI-based patient flow automation systems, today announced its COVID-19 solutions that are being used across health systems to plan for and mitigate the pandemic. The cloud-based solutions are equipping incident command centers with advanced predictive planning and capacity creation capabilities, and are available immediately for new clients to deploy within weeks. Together, these solutions allow health systems to address each phase of the pandemic, from immediate planning, to short-term interventions, through longer-term transformation.

“As we work with leading health systems, two common themes emerge: the need to plan for and get visibility into the current status of critical hospital resources, and the need to free up these resources — to create ‘virtual’ capacity — to mitigate the impacts of a surge in demand,” said Mudit Garg, co-founder and CEO of Qventus. “These capabilities are proving to be essential during the COVID-19 outbreak, and will remain important as systems manage through the uncertain environment that will occur with the removal of social distancing, resumption of elective surgeries, flu season, and potential seasonal resurgence of the coronavirus.”

The four Qventus solutions are:

Qventus customers have already begun integrating these tools into their COVID-19 response. “The Qventus COVID-19 tools are critical to our pandemic strategy,” said Dustin Skaya, System Director of Patient Placement & Transfer at Marshfield Clinic. “We can quickly see where key resources will be falling short and how to get ahead of those constraints.”

1,Appnovation working with Ministry of Health in British Columbia on digital solutions to prevent spread of COVID-19 between province wide healthcare facilities,https://news.yahoo.com/appnovation-working-ministry-health-british-100000395.html,"Cross contamination of the COVID-19 virus from one healthcare facility to another poses a serious health risk to patients and healthcare workers. The digital solution created by Appnovation is helping reduce that risk.VANCOUVER, April 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Appnovation, a Vancouver-based global digital consultancy, is working with the Ministry of Health in British Columbia and the Provincial Health Officer (PHO) to support a Single Site Staffing initiative among the province's long-term and assisted living facilities. This project focuses on the development of business processes, digital systems, real-time collaboration to support the collection, analysis and reporting of personnel data that will allow the health employers to make decisions about provincial healthcare resourcing in order to lessen the risk of COVID-19 transmission between healthcare facilities.Reducing Cross Contamination of COVID-19Like other provinces, B.C. is undertaking measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. Staff in healthcare facilities - from nurses to administration and food service workers - are among the most exposed and at-risk groups of people for contracting and spreading the virus as they care for the growing number of cases in the province. In addition, many of these staff work at multiple healthcare facilities, which increases the chance of COVID-19 cross contamination between facilities. The B.C. Office of the PHO, led by Dr. Bonnie Henry, has made two executive orders on March 26th and March 27, 2020, that limit staff movement at provincial Long Term Care Facilities and Private Hospitals, and further request province wide facility employment data for all workers across both public and private health facilities, in order to identify and help allocate staff to work at a Single Site as a measure to lessen the risk of transmission of COVID-19 between worksites.The ultimate goal of Appnovation's engagement is to support the province to ensure sufficient staff at every worksite to safely meet patient care needs, as well as assign staff to a single healthcare facility for the duration of this pandemic. In effect, this will protect both healthcare workers and patients from unintentional transmission of the virus.A Digital Solution to an Urgent Healthcare ChallengeAppnovation consulted with the PHO to build a digital solution to address COVID-19 transmission concerns in both public and private provincial healthcare facilities. Working with government officials, Appnovation conducted analysis identifying the type of data that needed to be collected, as well as how to collect it securely and in a way that ensures privacy, as well as developed a common data standard across the province.Using modern cloud architecture delivered on Google Cloud Platform, in a matter of days Appnovation was able to design and deliver a highly secure data pipeline hosted in Canada, that collected staffing data for over 100,000 healthcare workers from 1,200 facilities. In addition, Appnovation delivered a mobile-enabled, easy-to-use website allowing multi-site workers across the province to enter their preferred employment site.The encrypted data is used to create visualization models of staffing across the province and provide insights and analysis for real-time reporting, enabling the PHO's working group and the regional Health Authorities to make important decisions about provincial resourcing.""The B.C. government was looking for a digital solution to solve a very real and very urgent healthcare problem,"" said Scott Wassmer, General Manager of Americas at Appnovation. ""Through Appnovation's consultation, data analytics and real-time insights, we've already been able to identify hot spots within the provincial healthcare facilities where there's a lot of staff working at multiple sites. With that information in hand, the team is able to support the Health Authorities on decisions about resourcing to prevent any unintentional spread of COVID-19, protecting both staff and patients.""Working Quickly to Prevent Unintentional Transmission of COVID-19Appnovation's digital solution is being used by a working group made up of the PHO, Ministry of Health, Health Employers Association of BC, and the Provincial Health Authorities.Understanding healthcare resourcing at a provincial level is an enormous task. Within a matter of days, Appnovation was able to work with the BC government to consult on strategy, build a secure data pipeline, collect and analyze personnel data from 100,000 healthcare workers.

    Laura Ingle reports.Pediatricians across the country have said they're worried about the potential for new outbreaks of diseases that had been eradicated years ago, because children are getting fewer vaccines overall, according to recent data.The number of non-flu vaccines ordered for children is at least 2.5 million doses lower than the same time last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Doctors in all 50 states have seen a steep drop in the number of kids coming in for routine visits, and it has resulted in children forgoing their routine vaccinations and boosters. ""The first fall was when the first case of COVID was identified in Washington,"" Dr. Jose Romero, the chief medical officer of the Arkansas Department of Health, said. ""There's been a significant fall following the declaration of a national emergency.""ARIZONA VINTAGE SHOP PRAISED FOR 'SPOT-ON' SIGN MANDATING MASKS: 'LOVE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR'Many parents said they didn't feel safe bringing their healthy kids to the doctor and risk them contracting COVID-19. ""People voted with their feet and didn't come,"" Dr. Eileen Costello, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, said. ""We were seeing only about 10 percent of our usual volume of kids."" ""We serve a population that has been disproportionately impacted by this illness,"" Costello added. ""I think that made us especially worried that people were not going to want to come to the hospital with their kids to protect them against an illness that could have more devastating outcomes than COVID-19 for a child.""To combat the decline in vaccinations, local pediatricians around the country have been coming up with creative ways to get kids protected.SURGEON GENERAL JEROME ADAMS: STRICT LOCKDOWN WON'T MATTER IF WE DON'T FOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCINGBoston Medical Center is one of those hospitals, rolling out what it called ""Plan B."" The hospital partnered with Brewster Ambulance Service and borrowed one of its vehicles. Nurses started calling patients and mapping out routes for the doctors to administer vaccines on children's driveways. So far, the program has helped get more than 450 kids vaccinated. Other states have opted to try drive-up or curbside doctor visits; some states were encouraging parents to get vaccinations from pharmacists at their local drugstores. Arkansas Children's Hospital opened a drive-thru vaccine station in April to make sure its established primary care patients had an easy opportunity. Hospital officials reported that parents have had great things to say about it. Other physicians were choosing to see sick patients in the morning and healthy children in the afternoon. Romero is also the chief of pediatric infectious disease at Arkansas Children's Hospital. He said the biggest concern for health officials has been a potential outbreak of non-COVID-related viruses.""If you don't have enough people, enough children immunized in a community, you can start up with an outbreak like we see in other states in the past,"" Romero said. ""If we start to lose that buffer zone that we have with lots of children immunized, we're going to start to see diseases that in my career have been eradicated.""CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPRomero said his most important message to parents was that it's safe to go get vaccinated.

1,Some Israeli clinics said to start using new ultrasound coronavirus test,https://www.timesofisrael.com/some-israeli-clinics-said-to-start-using-new-ultrasound-coronavirus-test/,"An Israeli health maintenance organization (HMO) has started using a new sort of test to immediately discover coronavirus carriers even if they aren’t experiencing outward symptoms, a report said Thursday.
Patients of the Maccabi HMO can now undergo a special ultrasound test that scans their lungs and detects effects typically caused by the respiratory virus, Channel 12 reported, citing Maccabi officials.
    
The officials were quoted as saying the small, portable ultrasound kit called “Focus” had already helped discover several asymptomatic patients, and that several who tested negative were re-diagnosed with COVID-19.

One of them is a special education teacher who had caught the virus but was no longer showing symptoms and was cleared by a testing lab as recovered. Her test, taken out of caution before returning to work, revealed she still had the virus, according to Dr. Eran Shankar, who manages the Bnei Brak clinic.
The machine is currently in use only in virus hotspots such as the ultra-Orthodox cities of Bnei Brak and Elad, and will soon be available throughout the country, according to the report.
“The test saved the need for x-ray tests and the radiation they entail,” Shankar added. “It also prevents the patient being exposed to other patients and staff members who could get infected.”
“This capability allows us to locate the disease, especially in outbreak areas, even in people who seem to be completely healthy,” said Dr. Sharon Hermoni-Alon, head of family medicine at Maccabi.

1,Walk-in coronavirus antibody testing is launched at urgent care clinics across New York,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8266973/Walk-coronavirus-antibody-testing-launched-urgent-care-clinics-New-York.html,"By Frances Mulraney For Dailymail.com  Published:  19:08 EST, 28 April 2020   |  Updated:  01:48 EST, 29 April 2020    12View  commentsLong lines formed outside City MD locations Tuesday as eager New Yorkers took advantage of new walk-in COVID-19 nasal swab and antibody tests.The New-York based healthcare company announced Monday that it will be able to conduct a nasal swab molecular test on patients who currently have coronavirus symptoms and provide an antibody test on those who had symptoms but have since recovered.  The announcement came after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo revealed that an average of 31 percent of New York City residents tested for coronavirus over the last 14 days have received positive results. Waits of up to three hours were reported Tuesday across City MD locations as some social media users voiced concerned that the crowds were making social distancing difficult. Social media users warned that they were not able to social distance in the waiting roomsLong lines formed outside of CityMD locations across New York City as eager city residents waited for an antibody test to see if they had had coronavirus or not. The company announced Tuesday it was opening up walk-in antibody testing from Tuesday onwardCity MD, which has more than 120 urgent cares centers in New York, New Jersey and Washington state, revealed the increased testing in a press release Monday before rolling out the new antibody testing on Tuesday.The COVID-19 swab test is available to those experiencing active symptoms such as a fever and persistent cough. It is also available to healthcare workers, first responders and people who believe they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19 in the past 14 days.It will take three to five days for results to be delivered and patients are warned to self-quarantine during this period.The company is also offering antibody testing ‘with high accuracy’, it said in its press release, to see if a patient had previously contracted coronavirus. These test results will also be delivered within three to five days and is available to people who previously had COVID-19 symptoms; those who received a positive test result for COVID-19 and have now recovered after 14 days; and people who believe they have come into contact with somebody who had the virus.The nasal swab test is available to those who are insured. Those who are uninsured or self-pay will be charged for the cost of the CityMD visit as well as lab fees.The antibody test is said to be covered by most insurance companies but costs $55 for the City MD’s lab partner if not.CityMD's announcement for open antibody testing was welcomed on social mediaPeople who went to a CityMD to take a walk-in test posted about it and praised staffMany showed long lines forming in front of the CityMD locations for testingThe news was welcomed on social media where several users posted their experience of waiting through long lines on the first day of testing Tuesday.‘Just got an email from CityMD saying they can now offer covid tests to anyone that needs one and i just got emotional,’ Twitter account Astrology by Mecca wrote. Twitter user Lindsay Moore said that there was a two-hour wait outside the CityMD they went to.Another commended the ‘super helpful and friendly staff’ after waiting for an hour for an antibody test at CityMD in Park Slope in Brooklyn. ‘Took about an hour from the time I got in line (around 3 pm). Staff was super helpful and friendly,’ Marc Torrence, a reporter with Patch, posted.People heading to Brooklyn locations were all faced with a wait. 'Waiting to take an antibody test at a CityMD in Brooklyn. The length of the line indicates quite a lot of demand for this,' wrote Sarah Goodyear. Some were concerned about the effects that the lines for coronavirus testing would haveSome called for appointments to be scheduled to avoid long lines and to promote safer social distancing in the CityMD locations that are offering coronavirus and antibody testingThe long lines caused concern for some who were worried that the rush to be tested meant people were not following social distancing guidelines as some called for appointments to be arranged at the clinics that generally function as walk-in only.'Don’t talk to me about opening back up. @CityMD announced last night that #COVID19 testing was now available at it’s locations. Today I saw a line around the block at the 2 locations I passed. The curve may be flattening but it is NOT flat. #StayHome we aren’t there yet!' Meghan Lapides warned.  Another social media user who went to get a test showed the scenes from inside the center where he said that social distancing wasn’t an option in the crowded waiting room.'At @CityMD in line for an antibody test. front desk says testing will be at doctor's discretion. social distancing is not an option in the waiting room. waiting 55 minutes so far,' Rusty Zimmerman posted to Twitter. 'Admitted for my vitals to be taken, 1hr in crowded waiting room. 20min. later technician came in and took vitals. 85 minutes total, and counting... meanwhile, @CityMD maybe do like @wegmans put some tape on the ground 6' apart down the block out front?' they added. Staff were praised, however, and described as 'awesome': 'Total time, 1 hour 55 minute. bought fruit for staff to say thank you.'This Twitter user posted about the long wait times and lack of social distancingThis Twitter user suggested Tuesday that tape needed to be introduced in the CityMD waiting rooms to ensure that New Yorkers crowding in for a test were not too close to each other People who went to CityMD for a test Tuesday posted about their long wait timesThose who posted about the testing commended the staff and said they hoped they'd be able to donate plasma after taking the antibody test which would show if they had had the virus‘The entire staff of @CityMD was very calm and reassuring,’ said another Twitter user.‘They wore masks, but not gloves. Lots of hand sanitizer available, and some of them were wearing two masks. They said so far no one on staff has gotten sick.’Those eager to get tested felt it was ‘important’ to do so.‘Since I do backup childcare for my grandkids (who haven’t been to school/daycare for 7 weeks) it seems important. There was a short line when I arrived,’ Yvonne Caruthers, who went to an unidentified CityMD location, tweeted.‘Good physicial distancing inside. I checked in at a kiosk (sign said “please use wipes between checkins” but there were no more wipes).‘When the lab tech came to take my blood, she told me they got very little notice that they would be doing antibody tests, so they haven’t had time to adjust.’Staff were described as 'super helpful and friendly' as patients waited for hours New Yorkers who went for a test said they felt it was 'important' to do soWhile some complained about social distancing, others commended the conditionsGov. Cuomo on Tuesday revealed his 12-step plan to reopening state which includes keeping hospital capacity beneath 70 percent and seeing solid two-week declines in coronavirus cases in the areas he will restart, but said it would take a 'miracle' for New York City to reach the requirements in the next few weeks.Cuomo's lockdown officially ends on May 15 but he said on Monday he would extend it for some regions of the state where the data suggests there is still a problem.The first step of the plan is to ensure that the region being reopened has seen declining coronavirus cases for 14 days.New York City is a long way front that benchmark.There were 335 deaths across the state on Monday which brings the total to 17,638.There were another 3,110 cases, which brings the total number of positive COVID-19 infections to 295,106.Cuomo is adopting the White House's recommendation that for every 1,000 people, 30 coronavirus tests are required. The state is currently carrying out some 20,000 diagnostic tests every day but he previously said he hoped to increase that number to 40,000 a day.What will be crucial, he said, is ensuring the tests are easily accessible and are well advertised.Symptomatic people and front line workers will be prioritized, he said.'We have to have the testing regiment in place and prioritize symptomatic people and front line and essential workers.'They do have a higher rate of infection because they're putting themselves in harm's way so we want to make sure we have the testing.'Do we have the right number of sites? Testing won't work if it's too hard to get. The advertising is very important. It has to be available but people need to know it's available. They have to know what the symptoms are.'This is about people understanding it and buying into it. This is not government orders. People get it. They know the facts and they do it because we have communicated successfully the circumstance and the facts.'You need that testing and need it to trace the contacts otherwise you see that infection rate increase,' he said.Last week, Cuomo announced that Mike Bloomberg was launching a tracing program that would work to identify everyone who every infected person in New York has come into contact with to try to weed out other as yet undetected cases.The recruiting effort for that program is underway. People with experience in healthcare are being asked to apply for jobs which Mayor Bill de Blasio said will pay between $50,000 and $65,000.Throughout the reopening plan, healthcare workers and other essential workers who Cuomo said had risked their own lives out of a sense of pride and duty to serve the public, would be put first.They include not only doctors and nurses but transit workers and grocery store workers, cops and firefighters, all of whom have not stayed home.He said it had been one of his biggest fears at the onslaught of the pandemic that they would refuse to show up to do their jobs but that they all had.They will get first access to testing and will be protected with the equipment they need to do their jobs, he said.

The clinical trial results will be submitted under an 'emergency use' authorization in both China and the United States.""With a proven platform and a China clinical trial already underway for influenza, we are uniquely positioned to rapidly bring accurate and easily deployable coronavirus testing closer to the patient and away from the central lab,"" said Hong Cai, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mesa Biotech, Inc. ""Our technology development started at Los Alamos National Lab supported by NIH grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Western Regional Centers for Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease program. Since the beginning we have focused on technology suited for emergency defense and rapid deployment for SARS, Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases. Mesa's platform was specifically designed for use outside the lab to enable rapid responses to global pandemics, such as COVID-19.""""Since coronavirus symptoms are very similar to the flu, the Accula Flu A/Flu B test can aid physicians to 'rule in or rule out' the flu,"" added Cai. ""This combined knowledge is designed to provide health care professionals rapid, accurate results to screen, isolate, treat or dismiss potential carriers of the virus.""Currently, regional hospitals, cruise ships, airports, hotels and other locations are being overwhelmed and the requirement to send samples to a reference laboratory for testing, which takes two or more days, is not meeting timely demand.

As the healthcare infrastructure is becoming overwhelmed and hospitals around the world are reaching their capacities, new alternative possibilities are emerging. In response to bed shortage and facility saturation, architects around the world are taking action, in the on-going fight against the coronavirus. Focusing their knowhow to find fast and efficient design solutions that can be implemented anywhere, they are proposing flexible, fast assembled, mobile, and simple structures. With a very tight timetable, some projects are already implemented and in service, while others remain on a conceptual level, waiting to be adopted.+ 61Although in general, the planning guidelines for new hospitals dictates that 15 to 20 % of spaces should be dedicated to transmittable diseases, most of the facilities around the world couldn’t have anticipated a pandemic of this scale. As a result, Carlo Ratti has converted shipping containers into intensive-care pods, consisting of rapidly mounted, easily movable and safe units. CURA, a safe isolation ward, containing all the medical equipment needed has its first prototype ready. In the Philippines, WTA put in place 60 emergency quarantine facilities, repurposing one of their pavilions into a short-term relief space. The temporary structures made from wood and plastic can be replicated anywhere in order to increase the capacity of hospitals. Other more conceptual approaches include the mobile units designed by the startup JUPE HEALTH, rapidly deployed rest and recovery units, as well as mobile ICUs. At ""1/30th the cost of a hospital room"", they are designed and built for doctors by doctors and can be shipped anywhere.On the other hand, In New York, officials, who are anticipating the need of 10 times the existing rooms, are seeking to generate useful spaces for patients by either altering the capacity of existing structures or converting buildings with a different program, like office spaces, stadiums, convention centers, etc. which already have the required basic amenities such as proper HVAC and treatment infrastructure. Moreover, to help with identifying alternative sites suitable for patient care, the American Institute of Architects has released a new design guide from their COVID-19 Task Force, a rapid evaluation to recognize compatible buildings that can support patient care operations. In line with this logic, Opposite Office has proposed to transform the New Berlin airport, under construction since 2006, into a “Superhospital” for coronavirus patients. The adaptive reuse alternative can be implemented in any airport in the world since traffic is nowadays limited and restricted.Furthermore, specialized architectural companies like MASS published guidelines for limiting contagion in COVID-19 Temporary Tent Clinics. Founding their research on past epidemics, MASS explains that the risk of cross-contamination is high when people are located in tight quarters. In order to limit the transmission of diseases, 3 main ideas are to be crucially adopted: limit droplet spread between people, by designing for distances between people of 6’ or more to prevent direct contact with respiratory droplets; mitigate contagion via surfaces, by identifying, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces; and control for airborne infection by preventing, diluting, and removing contaminated air.In order to highlight different design approaches, inspire creative solutions, and encourage fast responses, we have put together initiatives from architectural platforms, addressing the current problematic, each presenting a novelty and introducing a distinct concept. A spatial protocol, an urban quarantine camp, emergency medical shelters, fast erected hospitals made out of recycled shipping-containers and inflatable fabrics, mobile low-cos facilities, hospital ships, and personal protective spaces for doctors are amongst the functions proposed. 50SuperReal/ Professors of IE School of Architecture and Design+ 61Through adaptability, prefabrication, optimization, rapidity, re- and up-cycling, as well as ""updatability"", Adapta is a spatial protocol based on resilience, on preparation and collaboration beforehand. A globally adaptable design that can be deployed in a crisis, Adapta creates a spatial solution that can be applied anywhere in the world, and in a matter of seconds, reducing the overhead of the human design process to almost zero. Assuming modular pre-existing units, which are ideal for emergency construction, 50SuperReal designed a solution where all additional construction materials are sized to fit in the modular unit itself, in case the building needs to be packed down and moved to a new site.Plastique Fantastique + 61Fighting against COVID-19, doctors might be exposed to the infection when masks and protective suits are in shortage. The Mobile PPS is a space where doctors can treat patients in a protective space. It has constant overpressure, which means, the air flows only towards the outside of the space, not letting the virus coming inside. The air supply is guaranteed by a ventilator located outside or in an extra decontaminated space.AGX ARCHITECTS+ 61As India and the world are facing a shortage in healthcare infrastructure, AGX ARCHITECTS is proposing an effective solution that can be manufactured and deployed as soon as possible and has the potential of scaling up. In fact, they created a structure that can act as a quarantine hospital unit or quarantine shelter for an individual. The effectiveness of the design is at less cost, less skillset required, minimum site operations, easily available materials, efficient logistics and minimum installation time. A component system is developed to increase and decrease the size of the unit as per need.MMW Architects+ 61As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, MMW Architects have designed an efficient, flexible and affordable modular hospital to increase intensive care capacity on a national- and international level. The construction system of the hospital is based on the use of recycled shipping-containers and inflatable fabrics, assembled in an innovative way to meet the strict requirements for air contamination in hospitals. The system can accommodate both isolators and larger patient rooms based on needs and circumstances. The system is intended to be a contingency hospital that will function as a satellite hospital physically close to a larger hospital.Weston Williamson + Partners+ 61Trying to encourage a global response, Weston Williamson proposes hospital ships, since the container module is ideal for an intensive care bed and medical equipment. With 3,500 containers per vessel, patients would only stay on the ship in the circumstances where there is no place to deploy the containers. The containers are adapted by having one of the steel doors removed and a perspex panel riveted in place. The perspex also has a hit and miss panel for natural ventilation and a built-in air-conditioning unit.VHL.Architecture+ 61VHL.Architecture cooperated with Da Nang Architecture University to design a model of Mobile Hospital to help solve the current shortage of beds while ensuring the full functions and facilities of a medical examination and treatment facility. Quickly built for mass production at the factory, with low installation costs, the project takes on the basic 20-foot container and divides it into 3 parts.  The frame is a 30mmX60mm iron box, while the floor is made from light-weight cement panels with standard dimensions. Medical equipment will be placed either in the red box or under the ground to save space.HAHA Architects Group+ 61The project of the Field Rescue Center (FRC) was created as a concept of a mobile diagnosis and treatment facility. Its purpose is to be used in times of crisis such as epidemic, pandemic, natural disaster, refugee crisis or humanitarian missions when it is crucial to quickly provide medical help to a vast number of people. The Field Rescue Center is able to fulfill the tasks of a fully functional temporary hospital. Consisting of TEU containers FRC is a mobile structure, easy to transport. Thanks to moving parts and hydraulics the assembly is pretty much self-acting. The modular structure of the facility allows it to be assembled in any configuration, depending on the characteristic of the critical situation and the number of people that seek medical help.KOTKO+ 61CNC-MEM or Computer Numerical Control used for the creation of a Medical Emergency Module responds to the current COVID-19 crisis, which inspires a design that can be conceptualized and polish, to be open source. Produced with a total of 6 1.22cm X 2.44 cm Plywood Sheets, with few other materials, the intervention can be cut in less than a day and assembled in less than 10 minutes. Every module is able to harbor 1 patient. Its main purpose is to grow, creating a mutable configuration according to the available landscape. The project aims to create a social architecture that provides options for immediate needs.Gonzalo Guzman+ 61The main idea was to design a very simple shelter that could be easily transported and easily built. The dimension would permit us to stack many modules and carry them in any truck. Each module consists of a rigid structure of panels that can be folded down and coverage of sailcloth for extra wind and water protection. This module can be adapted to any situation where emergency shelter is needed and the rigid panels can be made of any material according to the availability. The simplicity of the form is in response to the effectiveness and economy.INFEKTTo overcome the economic and social catastrophe of the coronavirus outbreak; sustainable quarantine systems must be adapted to anywhere that is fighting with the virus and still need to provide for its residents. CAMP-15 is a way of quarantine-living, a zone adapted from a park to resident isolation. Park facilities such as showrooms, galleries, restaurants, warehouses, and many open doors areas are transformed into dormitories, offices and leisure areas for mild and no-symptom patients. Under 24-h observation from medics; this zone is where any COVID-19 Positive patient can go and live for 15 days until the quarantine period is over. Bio-architecture Formosana (BaF) + 61BaF has worked together with a group of experts to develop a prototype for a negative pressure isolation ward and examination station for the emergency quarantine. This proposal aims to address the lack of wards in the hospital for treatment. The mobile emergency quarantine hospital proposes a few key considerations which include lightweight, fast, modular, flexible for expansion and reduction, affordable, weatherproof, mobile, safe, and secure. The material for this shall be readily available and standardize enough for quick fabrication. The idea considers prefabrication and on-site assembly while minimizing in-situ construction. These units can be quickly constructed to respond to various terrains and conditions with minimal changes.We invite you to check out ArchDaily's coverage related to COVID-19, read our tips and articles on Productivity When Working from Home and learn about technical recommendations for Healthy Design in your future projects.

 With dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in Bhubaneswar fast running out of beds, the Odisha government has moved to discharge patients after 10 days from the date of sample collection. The move is intended at ending overstaying in these hospitals. A high-level meeting, chaired by State’s Development Commissioner, resolved that as per the discharge protocol, a patient stood clinically discharged after 10 days from the date of sample collection provided he had no symptoms for the last three days. The proceedings of the meeting said, “Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation will prepare the list of such patients on ninth day district wise and post in the collectors WhatsApp group. The concerned collector will take step to pick those cured cases on the 10th day from the respective COVID Hospitals of Bhubaneswar by sending vehicles for pick up.” In case of default, such cured patients would be transferred from the hospitals to COVID-19 care homes in the city. Odisha had created 48 COVID-19 hospitals, having 7,328 beds and 710 intensive care unit beds. There were 1,180 beds and 236 ICU beds available in four COVID-19 hospitals in Bhubaneswar. In Cuttack city, 266 beds and 34 ICUs were available. As per information presented at the meeting, the COVID-19 hospitals in Bhubaneswar were being used by all other districts as referral hospitals. It was observed that the other districts were not following the standard operating procedure. “The available facility at the district-level must be utilised to the fullest extent before referring a patient to the COVID-19 hospitals in Bhubaneswar,” said official sources. It was decided that the facilities available in the cluster districts would be exhausted first before deciding to shift patients to Bhubaneswar. All districts would check with the city COVID-19 hospitals about the availability of the requisite facility needed before sending a patient. The government has threatened to withhold payment to the Bhubaneswar-based KIIMS Hospital if deliberate delay was made to make ICUs functional at Balangir, Mayurbhanj and Kandhamal districts. Functional ICUs would help decrease in critical patient load in the COVID-19 hospitals of Bhubaneswar, it was noted. In another significant step, the government decided to give emphasis on mentioning cyclic threshold value in the RT-PCR testing. “This value determines the viral load of the positive cases. If the CT value is known, then the cases can be prioritised for admission to COVID-19 care centres,” it said. To ease the pressure on COVID-19 hospitals, the government had asked officials to promote home isolation as well as enforce that all private hospitals earmarked 10% of their bed capacity for COVID-19 treatment. Even private players, who had partnered with the government to create dedicated COVID-19 hospitals, should divert 10% of beds for COVID-19 treatment. Odisha’s COVID-19 cases, meanwhile, surged past the 1.5 lakh mark, with 50,000 cases added up in the past two weeks. You have reached your limit for free articles this month.

1,A medical device built over Zoom could help solve ventilator shortages and change the way hospitals treat respiratory illnesses beyond the coronavirus,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/rapid-medical-parts-ventilator-parts-company-built-over-zoom-2020-4,"EDITIONLike many Americans, Jim Regenor decided to leave a major US city to wait out the coronavirus crisis somewhere less populated.But unlike most people, Regenor decided to start up a brand-new business during the crisis to help hospitals facing equipment shortages – and he grew an idea into a 15-person business with a Department of Defence contract in 12 days.Regenor, a former Air Force colonel, was in Boston when the virus hit, participating in Techstars’ Air Force accelerator for a manufacturing-focused startup he launched last year. When Boston went into lockdown, Regenor headed back to his current hometown near Buffalo, New York. He decided to start a new company when he noticed that hospitals were maxing out their equipment during the outbreak.Regenor’s company, Rapid Medical Parts, created a device that converts CPAP machines, which are typically used to treat sleep apnea, into machines that can treat COVID-19 patients. The team has been building the device over Zoom, meeting twice a day, and chatting over Slack or by phone in the interim. Regenor described the team makeup as mostly “aerospace guys,” as well as a ventilator expert and a doctor.“We’ve done all this without ever meeting each other face-to-face, without ever having more than one person in any room at any time, spread out between Salt Lake City, Florida, Arizona, California, Washington state, Connecticut, and Buffalo,” Regenor told Business Insider.Rapid Medical Parts’ device – which the company is calling an “emergency ventilator solution,” or EVS-4 – has about 95% of the functionality of a standard ventilator for “a fraction of the cost,” Regenor told Business Insider.It’s different from other devices that convert CPAP machines, he said, because it’s able to adjust the pressure provided by the device. That means the machine will work on mild COVID-19 cases as well as more severe cases where the patient needs to be intubated. In theory, EVS-4 would provide an alternative to standard ventilators, which can cost around $US20,000.“The idea is, where can you provide optionality for hospitals so they can use their high-end equipment on the most severe patients,” Regenor said.The company is still waiting on approval from the Food and Drug Administration before it can start producing the device, but Regenor expects that approval by the end of the month. Given that EVS-4 uses equipment that’s already approved by the FDA, Regenor hopes the process will be quick.Once Rapid Medical Parts gets up an running, Regenor said he expects to be able to make 400 to 600 kits a day, resulting in thousands per week. The plan is to manufacture the devices at several locations, but Regenor said the process is “supply-chain dependent,” which has become strained during the lockdown. If parts become scarce, the company plans to convert to some 3D-printed parts instead, he said.Starting a new business during a global crisis comes with other risks beyond supply-chain issues, however. While the company has already received funding from the DoD, the market for Rapid Medical Parts’ device would theoretically shrink, or at least change significantly, once the pandemic passes. But Regenor said the company thinks its device will be useful in treating other respiratory illnesses, like the flu or pneumonia, particularly in parts of the world that can’t afford traditional ventilators.“The cool part is, it’s actually really a whole new way to view invasive and noninvasive ventilation, so I think we will have legs beyond this crisis,” Regenor said. The company expects that going forward, most of its customers will be governments, NGOs, and hospital systems.In the meantime, however, Rapid Medical Parts is working around the clock to try to get its device ready to treat COVID patients.“First week or so I couldn’t sleep because I was so wrapped up in this, making sure it works and we get it done,” Regenor said. “The days are a blur. There are no weekends. We wrap up late in the evening and start back up first thing in the morning.” Have you pivoted your business to help during the coronavirus outbreak? Or have you started a new company in response to the current crisis? Please email

1,MIT's new way to remotely monitor vital signs over time could help with early COVID-19 detection in care homes,https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/mits-new-way-to-remotely-monitor-vital-signs-over-time-could-help-with-early-covid-19-detection-in-care-homes/,"MIT researchers have been building out the capabilities of a system they created that can monitor vital signs without requiring any direct contact sensors or wearables — using wireless signals already present in the environment. Now the team, which is working out of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), is taking their system even further, with the ability to identify a specific individual as one they’ve monitored previously, keeping their records tied to them over time, all while preserving privacy by not connecting this to any personal information about the subject.The new tech, which is called “RF-ReID” is useful because it could allow for monitoring individuals cohabiting in a group over time, like seniors in a retirement or long-term care facility, for instance. This development is particularly important because the ability to monitor an individual over time is crucial for actually being able to observe and detect any deviation from a healthy baseline.While healthcare facilities obviously employ a number of different measures to monitor resident and patient vital signs over time, these can run into potentially serious limitations. Cameras aren’t very privacy-respecting, and they also have limitations in terms of identifying individuals consistently over time, depending on even superficial changes to their appearance, like wearing different clothes. Remote monitoring devices are only as good as the memories and consistency of the individuals employing them, whereas the MIT CSAIL system works independent of any on-person device.The team that developed RF-ReID say that It can re-identify a new individual introduced to the system after less than 10 seconds of physical activity, using signals including body size, walking speed and gait style, all of which it infers from data collected by wireless radio signals present in the environment.Because it doesn’t need any existing biographical or personally identifiable private information to work, this could prove the basis of privacy-preserving monitoring systems that could be used even in the identification of potential COVID-19 cases in care homes. The researchers suggest that the system could flag any potential onset of symptoms, prompting care workers to do an in-person round of screening and/or testing."
1,New robot technology to fight Covid care isolation - BBC ä¸­æ–‡ç½‘,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53241556,"By Kenneth MacdonaldBBC Scotland Science CorrespondentNew solutions to the Covid-19 crisis in the care sector are being sought by a laboratory that is opening at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. Its creators are confident it is the world's first laboratory studying assisted living that researchers can use remotely. We all need help now and then, but people with physical and mental challenges need it much more, especially if they want to live independently. Real life human helpers have been the norm until now but the coronavirus pandemic has changed things rapidly and radically. That is why the new multi-disciplinary laboratory is aiming to create affordable technology that can support the care of vulnerable people cut off from human contact. It's not just the care that will be delivered at a distance - the lab itself will be open and remotely accessible. The Laboratory for Ambient Assisted Living (OpenAAL) will be available to researchers all over the UK. In the longer term it is hoped it will be open worldwide. It is being led by Dr Mauro Dragone, an assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University. He says researchers will be able to use Augmented Reality to ""teleport themselves into the laboratory"" and hopes it will ""help people co-design new technologies"". It is part of the National Robotarium, a UK centre of excellence which is a partnership between Heriot-Watt and Edinburgh universities. The applications could include supporting the more than 100,000 people in the UK Dr Dragone says are living alone with dementia, or any of the people whose care has been disrupted by the social isolation forced on the pandemic: people with multi-morbidity conditions, disabilities, or in the acute stages of mental ill health.And it won't be a top-down process. The ""co-design"" idea means involving the people on the receiving end of the care process. That's why the lab wants more collaborators from the care sector to join in. The Coalition of Care and Support Providers in Scotland is to play a key role in connecting the project to its more than 80 members in Scotland's third sector.The approach will go a lot further than creating clever, caring robots. It will involve experts in microsystems, wireless sensing, antennas, microwave and embedded systems, signal processing, data science, machine learning, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction.It will mean being able to unobtrusively monitor a vulnerable person's vital signs, detect patterns and trends in their behaviour and health, identify problems, help communication and social connections, and provide social and physical assistance. Dr Dragone says this is likely to include helping people receive virtual visits from friends and family. Robotic pets may be another way to help overcome isolation. The project is being funded by the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, under its Impact Acceleration Accounts scheme.It has already gained support from NHS Lothian, The Digital Health and Care Institute, Blackwood Home and Care Group, Consequential Robotics, Alcuris Ltd, Cyberselves and The Data Lab.Heriot-Watt are hoping more organisations will want to join in, virtually.

Researchers at New York hospitals have been quietly testing whether a common heartburn medication might help critically ill patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The researchers are affiliated with the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, the research arm of New York-based health system Northwell Health. They're currently running a clinical trial to test whether high doses of famotidine help critically ill coronavirus patients survive.They're testing a dose that's nine times the amount of famotidine, or Pepcid, that someone would usually take to treat their heartburn. It's delivered intravenously over a period of seven to 10 days. Patients in the study also get hydroxychloroquine, a malaria pill that's being evaluated to see if it can treat the coronavirus.The evidence the researchers are relying on to begin their trial is anecdotal. And there's no evidence yet from the trial itself that suggests famotidine is useful in fighting the coronavirus. Science magazine first reported on the study yesterday.Famotidine is the latest of dozens of drugs that are being tested in the treatment of the novel coronavirus, for which there are no approved treatments to date. Never miss out on healthcare news. Subscribe to Dispensed, our weekly newsletter on pharma, biotech, and healthcare.The trial, which began earlier in April, at first was kept quiet in the interest of making sure the investigators had enough famotidine to complete the trial, which will include 1,200 patients.""We didn't want to see supplies depleted for the clinical use for the COVID-19 studies or for the use of patients with serious medical needs,"" Dr. Kevin Tracey, the president and CEO of the Feinstein Institute, told Business Insider.He pointed to the shortages that emerged when experimental treatments like hydroxychloroquine were first discussed.""For us there was a concern that people would run out and buy famotidine without scientific evidence,"" he said.Tracey and the team at Northwell first heard about the potential for famotidine to treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients from Michael Callahan, a doctor affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital and the biotech company United Therapeutics. There were two anecdotes that he had on hand to support more research into using famotidine in the treatment of COVID-19, Tracey said. At the time, Northwell's 23 hospitals were at the center of the outbreak in the US and were mobilizing clinical trials to validate which treatments might work against the disease and which might not. To date, the organization has six clinical trials underway. ""We were confronted with something even today there is zero, no clinically proven effective therapy. Zero,"" Tracey said.The researchers had to weigh the safety of the drug with the potential it might have in helping very sick patients recover. ""That was the barrier,"" Tracey said.

The double-blinded trial run by the Feinstein Institute is randomizing patients either to receive famotidine intravenously alongside hydroxychloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine alone. They'll be evaluated against a control arm of patients treated earlier in the crisis. Those on the trial are hospitalized and have bilateral pneumonia and low oxygen levels in the blood as a result of the novel coronavirus.The patients undergo treatment for seven to 10 days, based on estimates of how to dose the medication high enough so that it might turn the virus off and keep it from replicating. ""Our first choice was not to have hydroxychloroquine in all patients,"" Tracey said.However, by the time the trial went underway the antimalarial medication had become a standard part of treating hospitalized patients, making it difficult to find patients who weren't on the drug. The researchers are looking into whether another arm can be added to the trial just evaluating famotidine without hydroxychloroquine. So far, 150 patients have been enrolled into the famotidine and hydroxychloroquine trial, a spokesman for the Feinstein Institute told Business Insider. To the organization's knowledge, it's the first clinical trial looking into whether famotidine helps in treating cases of COVID-19. The ultimate goal of the trial will be to see whether the medication helps patients survive COVID-19, evaluating how many have survived after 30 days compared to those who didn't receive famotidine.Researchers will also be looking at the amount of the virus in patients' bodies, if their oxygen levels improve, and if their stays in the hospital are shorter than those who didn't receive the treatment. ""What we'll know is whether patients derive benefit or harm,"" Tracey said. ""What they won't know is how exactly the drug is working if it does.""It'll be important to see the results of the trial before making any decisions about whether famotidine should be used in more widespread treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. ""We need the trials. We need it randomized, and we need it controlled,"" Dr. Thomas Maddox, who serves as chair of the science and quality committee of the American College of Cardiology, told Business Insider. ""If you don't do that, you don't know what the specific impact of any given drug is on a disease."" After reviewing some of the specifics of the trial published in Science Maddox said he was ""amazed"" at how quickly the trial was designed and put into action. Beyond the evidence the Feinstein team kept in mind when deciding to begin a famotidine trial, there isn't much to suggest that the heartburn medication is a potential treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.While famotidine is found in Pepcid, an over-the-counter medication, there's no evidence to support its use as a preventive measure or as a treatment for the novel coronavirus. ""All drugs have side effects. Famotidine has side effects. Drugs should not be taken without being guided by a physician,"" Tracey said. ""We don't know if famotidine will cause more harm than good.""Do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you'd like to share?

	While the whole country is fighting the pandemic and companies are trying to find a remedy for the Covid, some of India's top educational institutions, including IITs, IISC, deemed universities, have developed a number of low-cost and effective solutions to deal with the disease. Some of the areas in which these institute are working include diagnostics & surveillance, hospital assisting devices, modeling, simulation and analysis, preprints, sanitisation and disinfection, and vaccines, among others.
	IIT Delhi, for instance, has developed the world’s most affordable RT-PCR based Covid-19 diagnostic kit at a base price of Rs 399. Even after adding the RNA isolation and laboratory charges, the cost per test will be considerably lower than the kits currently available in the market. The probe-free diagnostic kit has been manufactured by Delhi NCR-based Newtech Medical Devices. IIT Delhi has given licences to 10 companies to make this diagnostic kit using the technology developed by its researchers.

	Union Human Resource Development Minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said that Corosure, the Covid-19 diagnostic kit developed by Indian IIT-Delhi, is a step towards Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's vision of a self-reliant India. He said the country needs cheap and reliable testing to help control the pandemic.
	""This affordable detection kit will help the country amid the ongoing crisis,"" he said.
	Jatin Goyal, Founder, Newtech Medical Devices said using the unique technology developed by IIT Delhi and the company's expertise in reagent and kit-making, they have ensured an accurate, affordable, Make-in-India kit for the diagnosis of Sars-CoV2. It is a 'probe-free' method and reduces the testing cost without compromising on accuracy. The company hopes to churn out two million kits by next month.
	IIT Madras-incubated start-up Modulus Housing has developed a portable hospital that can be installed by four people anywhere within two hours.

	Shreeram Ravichandran, CEO, Modulus Housing said health infrastructure is crucial in fighting any pandemic. With a contagious disease such as Covid-19, it is essential to have smart health infrastructure to screen, contain and treat people. Unlike urban areas, where there is plenty of existing infrastructure that can be converted to hospitals, rural areas do not have a lot of infrastructure. It is difficult to construct buildings from scratch as the requirement is immediate. As the rural population density is relatively low, more micro hospitals are a great help in tackling Covid-19 cases.
	Modulus is working on a dual design that would enable the portable hospital units to be rapidly launched as isolation wards. Post-Covid-19, these can be transformed into micro-hospitals/clinics in Rural India where the medical infrastructure needs to be augmented, Ravichandran said.
	The cost is Rs 14-15 lakh per MediCAB Unit with installation and set-up on site. The institute has collaborated with a government hospital for design & rapid construction of a modular ‘Doffing Unit’ for safe removal of PPE. A single unit costs about Rs 4 lakh. including transport to Chennai. The cost will reduce if multiple units are made, or large-scale production is required.

	IIT Graduate T E S Madhavan has developed a steam disinfection unit based on natural oils. The pressurised disinfection unit uses steam saturated with natural extract on humans to prevent community spread, and to weaken the coronavirus. The unit replaces the existing use of NaClO (Sodium Hypochlorite), Dettol, Lysol and other disinfectants, said Madhavan. A person entering this unit for about 30 seconds would get disinfected from head to toe.
	IIT Hyderabad has developed an AI-powered, low-cost point-of-care Covid testing kit. Each test costs around Rs 600 at the moment. However, mass production will help reduce its cost to about Rs 350 per test.
	Students and researchers at IIT Mandi have developed indigenous technology for high-efficiency face masks from waste PET bottles, a UV-C disinfection box, a foot-operated hand sanitiser dispenser to minimise the risk of Covid-19, and low-cost portable ventilators.
	Students and researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed solutions for diagnostics & surveillance, hospital assisting devices, and sanitisation and disinfection solutions. For example, a prototype of an electro-mechanical ventilator and serology assays that detect infection-specific antibodies in the serum of an individual are effective surveillance methods to understand the level of spread of infection in a population. The ventilator comes with minimum electronics and can easily interface with existing hospital infrastructure or hospital-like infrastructure for less than Rs 50,000.
	Kerala-based Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) has developed a rapid antibody card, a viral transport media (VTM) kit and a viral RNA extraction kit. RGCB developed the solutions in partnership with Sperogenx Biosciences and POCT Services under the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic umbrella.
	The rapid antibody card will help study the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, with 100 per cent sensitivity and 98 per cent specificity. It has the advantages of being cost-effective, sensitive and rapid. It also facilitates testing of a large number of samples at any level of clinical setting, public health centres and hospitals, which currently one of the big challenges.
	The VTM kit helps preserve the viability of viruses for up to 72 hours at refrigerated temperatures.The swabs have been designed ergonomically with a pre-moulded breakpoint on their shaft. Though there are similar products available, this kit can be marketed at a price that is 30 to 35 per cent less.
	Sastra University has developed a visual analytics tool to check social distancing and face mask compliance. Faculty at the institute developed high-speed AI-ML enabled Covid software using x-ray images before recommending RT-PCR test to reduce avoidable test demand.
	Anand Samuel, VC, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) said they are developing a point-of-care fiber-optic biosensor device for rapid detection of Covid-19. The institute has also developed a monoclonal antibody-based diagnostic method for the specific detection of covid-19 viral antigens. A five-layered mask with a nano embedded filter having potential antimicrobial property was developed by its researchers. An instrument for testing the Masks is now being used by Geetha Manivasagam of VIT. The institute will become the second accreditated body in India for masks.Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

                A test that would provide a positive COVID-19 result in as little as 5 minutes and a negative result within 12 minutes, may come to India in the third week of April, according to TV news reports. Each test kit is expected to cost between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.Developed by Abbott Laboratories, an American medical devices and healthcare company, the molecular point-of-care test for the detection of COVID-19 will available in the US from this week.Representational image. PTIYesterday, Bangalore-based biotech startup, Bione, also launched a rapid testing kit for the novel coronavirus - the first of its kind in India. It is approved by the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and can be used at home.Bione's kit requires blood from a prick of the finger and promises to give a result within 5-10 minutes. It would be priced at Rs 2,000-3,000. The company is expected to manufacture 20,000 kits per week. They will be available for sale on the company’s platform and delivered in 2-3 days of placing an order, according to a company spokesperson.Currently, government approved and supported labs are testing for COVID-19 using RT-PCR test. This test provides results within 45 minutes and the government has capped the cost for COVID-19 testing at Rs 4,500.On March 27, Abbott had announced that it had received US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) emergency use authorization for the test, which is being dubbed the fastest testing kit yet. The company has said it wants to prioritize frontline health workers - they will be given the first priority to get the test kits so they can continue doing their jobs and caring for the sick. Abbott expects to produce 50,000 kits daily and also plan to introduce different types of tests over the next few weeks or maybe months. According to CNBC, Abbott tests may be available in India by the third week of April. They also reported that the test was expected to be priced at Rs 500-1000 and would give a result within 15 minutes. These tests are only just reaching the different states in the US and the news of them coming to India has not been shared by Abbott or the Indian government yet. #CNBCTV18Exclusive | Abbott’s rapid diagnostic commercial kits may arrive in India by the 3rd week of April.

1,SCG working on coronavirus respirator solution for healthcare workers,https://www.autoblog.com/2020/03/25/scg-developing-healthcare-worker-face-shield/,"This page is for personal, non-commercial use. You may order presentation ready copies to distribute to your colleagues, customers, or clients, by visiting http://www.autobloglicensing.comUPDATE: Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus have finished a more simple version of their combination filter and face shield. The company released a video showing how it can be put together. It is important to note that it hasn't been approved by the FDA, so use should be carefully considered, perhaps after approved options have been exhausted. The company has also made it known that it is willing and able to start assembling the masks for hospitals that would like them. The video on how to put one together is below.https://t.co/eFIBqq1kFgThe necessity brought on the by novel coronavirus is resulting in many inventions. In Italy, a shortage of C-PAP masks and other respirators available to those afflicted with Covid-19 led a team to create a 3D-printed set of valves that connect to an off-the-shelf full-face snorkeling mask. Working with the plentiful masks sold by European sporting goods store Decathlon, the ""Charlotte"" and ""Dave"" valves permit numerous oxygen delivery setups to serve patient needs. Best of all, the inventors have made the design plans downloadable and free. In the U.S., where automakers are switching to the production of medical gear, Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus — having already donated its Connecticut factory space to serve as a hospital — is working on something similar to the Italian invention, but for medical personnel.A Facebook post explains company designers have teamed up with a mechanical engineer who's already designed medical equipment. Together, they're drawing up an injection-molded universal adapter for full-face snorkel masks that can fit a C-PAP in-line bacteria filter for healthcare workers to wear while they attend to patients. The automaker wrote that the ""basic idea is to create a tapered, medical-grade, allergenic stretchable fitting"" between the mask and an HME filter common in hospitals. One design allows for two filters and increased airflow. Such a device would essentially combine an N95 mask with a full-face shield, eliminating the need for a nurse to wear a mask under a shield.SCG said it was obligated to act after reading stories of nurses reusing N95 masks in neonatal units, of healthcare professionals forced to use bandannas for lack of anything better, and hearing from a doctor about driving around the state looking for additional supplies. The goal is to produce 4 million adapters that fit a wide range of masks sitting on the shelves of sporting-goods stores. SCG wrote in its Facebook posts that if it charges anything for the adapter, the price would only cover the cost of manufacture. A 3D printing company has already been in touch with SCG. If anyone has expertise that can assist with the effort, you can leave a note for the company on the Facebook post.     Please sign in to leave a comment.

    Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Doctors have observed a strange trend in more COVID-19 patients: people with blood oxygen saturation levels that are very low but who aren't gasping for breath.Although often quite ill, these patients are not presenting symptoms like most acute respiratory distress syndromes, which is a lung failure previously associated with the SARS outbreak in 2003 and other respiratory diseases.These types of patients are alert and feeling relatively well, but their lungs are not performing their proper function. This presentation is known as ""silent hypoxia"" and it's causing some people to arrive at the hospital in worse health than they realize.In a recent New York Times op-ed, Richard Levitan, an emergency room doctor who invented a procedure for teaching intubation -- the insertion of breathing tubes that many COVID-19 p patients require, explained that there might be a way around this issue.CHALLENGE OF TRACKING COVID-19'S 'STEALTHY SPREAD' REVEALED IN NEW STUDY
      A pulse oximeter is seen above.
      (Reuters)Silent hypoxia progressing rapidly to respiratory failure explains cases of COVID-19 patients dying suddenly despite not feeling short of breath.As Levitan notes in his op-ed, one reason COVID-19 is putting a strain on our public health system is the severity of lung injury patients have when they arrive in emergency rooms. Unfortunately, many patients aren't arriving in hospitals until their condition has already worsened, and then they often need to be put on ventilators.That can lead to a shortage of those machines -- and doctors having to make untenable decisions about rationing of care.""There is a way we could identify more patients who have Covid pneumonia sooner and treat them more effectively — and it would not require waiting for a coronavirus test at a hospital or doctor’s office,"" Levitan writes in the Times. ""It requires detecting silent hypoxia early through a common medical device that can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies: a pulse oximeter.""Pulse oximeters, which are carried by most EMTs, are small devices placed on a person's fingertip; with the press of a button, they display oxygen saturation and pulse rate.CORONAVIRUS HAS MUTATED INTO AT LEAST 30 DIFFERENT STRAINS, STUDY FINDSAccording to Levitan, the small devices saved the lives of two physicians he knows.""Widespread pulse oximetry screening for Covid pneumonia — whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors’ offices — could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with Covid pneumonia,"" the doctor writes.Get a daily look at what’s developing in science and technology throughout the world.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

1,Some Israeli clinics said to start using new ultrasound coronavirus test,https://www.timesofisrael.com/some-israeli-clinics-said-to-start-using-new-ultrasound-coronavirus-test/,"An Israeli health maintenance organization (HMO) has started using a new sort of test to immediately discover coronavirus carriers even if they aren’t experiencing outward symptoms, a report said Thursday.
Patients of the Maccabi HMO can now undergo a special ultrasound test that scans their lungs and detects effects typically caused by the respiratory virus, Channel 12 reported, citing Maccabi officials.
    
The officials were quoted as saying the small, portable ultrasound kit called “Focus” had already helped discover several asymptomatic patients, and that several who tested negative were re-diagnosed with COVID-19.

One of them is a special education teacher who had caught the virus but was no longer showing symptoms and was cleared by a testing lab as recovered. Her test, taken out of caution before returning to work, revealed she still had the virus, according to Dr. Eran Shankar, who manages the Bnei Brak clinic.
The machine is currently in use only in virus hotspots such as the ultra-Orthodox cities of Bnei Brak and Elad, and will soon be available throughout the country, according to the report.
“The test saved the need for x-ray tests and the radiation they entail,” Shankar added. “It also prevents the patient being exposed to other patients and staff members who could get infected.”
“This capability allows us to locate the disease, especially in outbreak areas, even in people who seem to be completely healthy,” said Dr. Sharon Hermoni-Alon, head of family medicine at Maccabi.

George Mason Drive) has opened up a new suite of patient rooms, each a bit larger than the typical hospital rooms with some features designed with COVID-19 in mind.“Virginia Hospital Center’s new 4th floor patient unit and nurses’ station opened in August, adding 21 more private rooms that are 30% larger than VHC’s standard rooms,” a spokesperson for the hospital said in a statement. “The interior design of the new unit continues the clean, modern aesthetic of the VHC campus creating a comforting space for patients and families.”The hospital said that each room will have a bathroom and shower, with individual temperature controls, televisions, a sofa for families, a reclining chair and bench.Perhaps the most important feature, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, is that each room can be converted to negative pressure, which lowers air pressure and requires any air leaving the room to pass through a filter.“Each patient room also has the ability to convert to negative pressure — an important feature when treating patients with highly contagious conditions, such as COVID-19,” the hospital said. “Negative pressure traps and keeps potentially harmful air particles within the room by preventing internal air from leaving the space.”The floor plan for the new unit also includes high-visibility nurses’ stations, along with private patient and family consultation rooms and a new lobby.“Every aspect of the new unit was carefully designed with the needs of both patients and caregivers in mind,” the hospital said, “and to create a nurturing environment that is conducive to healing.”Separately, Virginia Hospital Center is in the midst of a major expansion project."

By early April, Northwell Health had approximately 2,804 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 across its network. With numbers changing daily, Northwell Health estimates that approximately 25% of COVID-19 positive patients were in the ICU with approximately two-thirds (88%) of those patients on ventilators in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Northwell Health has an extensive TeleHealth program so that it is able to gather data in every one of its ICUs and it has an established acute lung injury center that includes VV ECMO programs for respiratory distress, commonly associated with COVID-19 cases.Northwell’s Saurabh Chandra, MD, PhD, Medical Director of Telehealth Services, and Iris Berman, RN, MSN, CCRN-K, VP of TeleHealth, share their team’s insight and experience on the COVID-19 pandemic situation to date and detail how they are using TeleHealth solutions to design virtual care strategies to combat it.Q1: We are all hyper alert to the status updates on COVID-19 but can you give us a brief situational overview as a healthcare provider to the crisis at hand? It’s a rapidly changing situation of course but, we can share the key facts that make CoVID-19 so alarming for healthcare providers. While the estimated mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower (3-4%) than past similar life-threating respiratory viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) which were approximately 10% and 20% respectively, the contagiousness of COVID-19 is much, much higher. It’s the combination of the two that makes it so difficult to control, anticipate how bad it will get or try to determine when exactly it will end.At the same time, much is unknown about COVID-19 and uncertainty is difficult to prepare for or align hospital resources against. Combined with that, our data tracking the outbreak can be inaccurate or underestimated because thousands of unsuspected cases are yet to be confirmed with tests (because testing is so difficult) and others with the virus may not have sought medical attention. Right now, we know that 180 countries globally already have the virus. In the U.S., we estimate that over 200 million Americans will get this virus at some point in time and a vaccine is about a year away.The priority now is to slow down the spread of COVID-19 so we don’t overwhelm our healthcare systems, our ventilator capacities, our critical care capacities. This is of paramount importance to ensure quality care and safety of our patients and staff through this pandemic.Q2: What is the potential impact of the coronavirus on critical care resources in particular? Can you explain why concerns are so high for the ICU?Concerns are high because when we look at published data on past pandemic models, it’s been estimated consistently that about 25 to 30% of patients will require critical care. When we assess the number of critical care beds available in the United States with the expected rise of cases and with the average duration of intubation in CoVID-19 (greater than 10 days) for patients in the ICU, the best case scenario is that we will have less than half the expected need for ICU beds. The availability of ventilators is another key concern. Estimates for patients that would require ventilators with CoVID-19 ranges widely from 10 to 50%. In a moderate model, we could see an appropriate match but, more realistic or severe models indicate that we could potentially see a massive gap.Additionally, even with conservative modeling of safe 12:1 patient-to-doctor ratios, there’s a mismatch. This creates alarming concern for not only patient quality and safety but also increases the moral burden and burnout of our teams exponentially. Based on the current American Health Association (AHA) COVID-19 model, only 51% of ICU beds are predicted to be safely staffed with only 13% of the required ventilators. And, this model assumes that everyone can work and only 25% of patients require a ventilator. However, there is a risk that more than 20 percent of our team members will be unable to work and more than 25 percent of patients will require a ventilator. At current state, if that becomes the case, it would outstrip our resources.Q3: In what ways are you leveraging TeleHealth in the ICU for the COVID-19 pandemic? What might other healthcare providers learn from your experience?Northwell Health started its TeleHealth program in 2014 with services that include: TeleICU; TeleStroke; TeleSNF; TeleHospitalist; pediatric, neuro and trauma critical care consultation; and, TelePsychiatry. It was a huge benefit for us as a healthcare provider to have an established and extensive TeleHealth network in place before going into this crisis. We have one of the largest cohorts of patients in the NY area so it gives us the ability to quickly combine experiences from many hospitals to get ahead of the learning curve and allows us to leverage TeleHealth in a unique manner.We are using Telehealth strategies to not only care for patients but also our own healthcare providers in our system. These include: expanding access to critical care services; triage and transfer; access to specialty services; standardization of care; maintaining critical care workforce; and, minimizing exposure to the bedside team. For example, we use TeleHealth solutions to monitor COVID-19 patients that are outside our critical care unit, expanding access to critical care services. This type of monitoring and consultation from a remote, central location allows us to rapidly assess the acuity of that patient and make the determination to transfer the patient to a tertiary center if needed while minimizing direct contact and potential cross-contamination.Access to specialty services is another big benefit, particularly because COVID-19 symptoms include respiratory distress. With TeleHealth services, we can provide remote consultation from our acute lung injury center experts. This enables us to leverage our resources most effectively especially at a time like this when resources and ICUs are overwhelmed. More importantly, our centralized TeleICU opens a dialogue amongst our staff on best practices (i.e. what works and what doesn’t) and disseminates our collective knowledge on COVID-19. This helps standardize the level of care in our healthcare system. It ensures that each and every patient in our health system is benefiting from that collective knowledge across our entire system in real-time. We have also leveraged TeleHealth in the ambulatory setting in hopes of decreasing exposure for our at-risk populations, keeping our emergency rooms (ERs) from full overload, and conserving PPE by allowing home visits with TeleHealth where appropriate.In addition to our centralized TeleICU, there are two key things we’re doing to minimize some of the risk for our staff as well. First, we are asking different hospitals in our network to provide a list of their critical care providers (including doctors, specialists) and providing both access and rapid training on software so they can see their own patients from their own building. Second, we’ve developed a TeleHealth strategy to minimize the exposure to the bedside team, which is typically the nurses who have the greatest risk of getting COVID-19 from frequent and close interaction with patients.The TeleICU nurse has a unique responsibility at the bedside so we created a new workflow to minimize exposure to the team and reduce cross-contamination. We knew this was critical as personal protective gear such as masks and face shields are becoming rationed with the growth of the COVID-19 crisis. Now, the bedside RN is encouraged to call the TeleICU team before entering the patient room so that we can monitor and guide them through what they are doing and facilitate bundled care. The TeleICU team stays on-camera with the healthcare team while they are at the patient bedside to provide real-time support for our nursing staff. This helps reduce stress for staff, helps us maintain our COVID-19 personnel checklist log, and ensures consistency on things such as hourly safety rounds on patient vitals and ventilator checks. It also enables us to educate and monitor Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements related to COVID-19 in real-time for compliance.Q4: How might the TeleHealth and TeleMedicine landscape change with this COVID-19 outbreak and declaration of a state of emergency in the US? The COVID-19 outbreak has really been a collective call-to-action for everyone. It made us re-examine healthcare processes on a global scale. At Northwell Health, we’ve seen first-hand how TeleHealth strategies have helped us adapt to this CoVID-19 challenge and contribute in a very meaningful way. Most prominently for us perhaps is how we were able to leverage existing TeleHealth solutions better while also devising new ways of working that we hadn’t implemented before to help us best help support and care for patients and protect our staff when social distancing became the new norm. We’re sharing our experience in the hopes of helping other hospitals deal with this crisis.With the President’s declaration of a “State of Emergency” and the “TeleHealth Services During Certain Emergency Periods Act” (TSDCEPA), we have seen the lifting of certain established limitations for care in homes and geographic regions since the Health and Human Services (HHS) department signed the waiver. This will largely determine how the regulatory and reimbursement implications play out and if TeleHealth will become designated as an essential service. Right now, we don’t have that designation formally. Also, we believe this will better inform long-term decisions by CMS (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) for use of TeleHealth beyond the COVID-19 emergency.Q5: What is needed to facilitate more virtual care solutions in the future? With COVID-19, we’ve seen temporary hospitals become a reality and mobile monitoring a necessity. We’ve realized through this crisis how important it is operationally to know where all our technology devices are and that they are able to connect and that our health tech solutions are supported. We’re doing really well with TeleHealth at Northwell but, at some point, as we increase the bandwidth of TeleHealth, interoperability and support become increasingly more important. Looking forward, we see many possibilities and potential for TeleHealth and TeleMedicine solutions. We would advocate that health tech solutions continue to advance so that TeleHealth strategies can be 24/7 regardless of location if we’re ever going to be able to keep up with the demand for the technology. The sooner we can get that done simply - the easier it will be for us provide anytime/anywhere care for every service line and every patient.Want more?

      COVIDReady combines FDA-authorized antibody and PCR testing, symptom checks, health risk screening and care management to aid employers' efforts to safely re-engage returning employees during business recoveryPORTLAND, Ore., May 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ayin Health Solutions (Ayin), the national population health management company of Providence St. Joseph Health, is launching COVIDReady, an end-to-end service that integrates health screening, symptom assessment, testing services, monitoring and health care coordination for employers seeking to safely reengage staff returning to the workplace.""Employers have heightened sensitivity to providing the safest work environments possible and they will need to thoughtfully offer resources that will help provide a healthy workplace. This includes social distancing measures as well as symptom monitoring for early detection and contact tracing – all occupational safety efforts newly redefined by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVIDReady provides a comprehensive program coordinating timely data, health information and resources that employers and employees need. Our services address COVID-19 protections in the workplace, screening, prevention, early illness detection, treatment and employee health improvement,"" said Rhonda Medows, MD, FAAFP, chief executive officer of Ayin Health Solutions.About COVIDReadyCOVIDReady is a holistic suite of population health tools necessary for employers to implement return-to-work strategies, keeping at the forefront the safety and care experience of the employee. As employers attempt to navigate turbulent economic times and re-engage their workforce, COVIDReady smooths the transition by making it simpler to manage business re-entry given the ever-evolving landscape.Employees can record daily symptoms directly on-line or in the mobile application as well as respond to health screening questions. The mobile application can be used to collect an employee's body temperature in an effort to help identify employees newly infected and symptomatic, as fever occurs in about half of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mobile application also enables contact tracing and monitoring of social distancing within the workplace. Screening and social distancing adherence are important pieces of the return-to-work plan.Testing for both the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and for active COVID-19 infection among the workforce, provides additional information to the employer and employees. This information helps them to understand how best to keep the employee population safe. COVIDReady uses tests which have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA). COVIDReady also features a cloud-based data platform that networks testing laboratories and clinicians and provides employer- and employee-only interfaces. Employees can self-register and receive a health care provider match for in-office testing by a CLIA-certified laboratory. After screening, employees can receive a COVIDReady-enabled referral as needed for further testing, symptom management, health status monitoring and care.At the heart of COVIDReady is the care team who will navigate the employee through the appropriate clinical pathway driven, in large part, by test results. Health status will continue to be an ongoing and daily concern for both employees and employers. The screening questions, testing services, and social distance monitoring will be supported by Ayin's care management teams in collaboration with providers and labs. The care team will help inform employees regarding prevention opportunities and educate employees on their health status. During the current health crisis, COVIDReady also will provide a comprehensive and recurring population health assessment in order to address immediate and evolving needs.COVIDReady is the first in a series of Connected Health modules Ayin plans to launch in the near future. Connected Health offers a suite of workplace modules that combine screening, diagnostic tests, symptom assessment, device monitoring, digital technology, telehealth and health care coordination. This comprehensive suite of services is designed to help organizations understand the health status of their employee populations and inform and manage employee health. Our services are focused on prevention and workplace safety.Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), the third-largest U.S.-based health system, established Ayin in February 2019 to equip payers, providers, employers, government entities as well as organizations focused on underserved populations with needed expertise and services. Specifically, Ayin helps simplify patient access to information, improve patient clinical care and outcomes, reduce costs, and capitalize on advantages of population-based healthcare, such as proprietary health risk evaluation tools and management of pharmacy and employee benefits.About Ayin Health SolutionsAyin Health Solutions is a national population health management company focused on helping organizations that are committed to improving patient outcomes maintain stability in a tumultuous healthcare landscape.

Alibaba owns a third of Ant, which was also co-founded by Ma.Ram Parameswaran, Octahedron’s founder, expects Ant to resume its IPO and is holding onto Alibaba shares despite China’s unveiling of new anti-monopoly rules.“It’s one of the cheapest commerce businesses in the world if you use a reasonable sum-of-the-parts valuation framework,” Parameswaran said. “There’s lots of monetization runway in the core business with live streaming and recommendation engines.”Despite a slowdown, Alibaba’s revenue is still increasing at least 20% per quarter, while its cloud unit is on track to become profitable for the first time in the year through March. Its Cainiao delivery network is also expanding at its fastest pace on record, boosted by cross-border trade.Coronation CapitalThe Hong Kong-based family office bought more shares of Alibaba after they tumbled on Wednesday and is planning to increase total exposure to about 3% from 0.5% over time.“Alibaba is still going to be a trillion-dollar company in the future,” said founding partner Jin Zi, whose firm manages about $300 million of assets. “Yes, the company is going to come under pressure in the next three-to-five months, but we are investing for the next three-to-five years, and we don’t think other competitors can topple Alibaba.”Kamet CapitalThe family office has been trimming its position in Alibaba, which is one of its largest investments. But it’s still retaining some exposure because Alibaba is highly correlated to a rebounding Chinese economy.The firm’s next moves will depend on how China’s recovery holds up and how policy makers implement the new anti-monopoly rules, said Kerry Goh, the firm’s Singapore-based chief investment officer.“Alibaba will be under pressure,” Goh said. “We want to see how the regulatory pressure balances out the economic recovery.”Commonwealth Avenue Asset ManagementThe macro-oriented investor has confidence that Chinese regulators know what they’re doing and that Ant will likely list within a year from now, albeit at a lower valuation.“Alibaba will still get benefits from the listing,” said Chong Sze King, the firm’s managing director in Singapore. “We think it’s a good time to buy.”Long Corridor Asset ManagementThe Hong Kong-based hedge fund, which oversees about $200 million, boosted its Alibaba position by one-third after the Ant IPO was pulled, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is private.Ali Sheikh, Long Corridor’s chief operating officer, declined to comment.(Updates with Alibaba share price in first and second graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman had his best trade of all-time earlier this year when he bet against the market, and he's  placing a similar bet again despite the market optimism surrounding the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.What Happened: Business Insider reports that Bill Ackman placed a new hedge against the market Monday.The news came on the same day Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) announced a 90% efficacy rate for their COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The desire to know where you land in the sea of retirement savers…It’s been said that gridlock is a feature, not a bug, of the US Constitution, and we may be about to find that out. The election results have left some questions to be resolved, but a few things are coming clear: Democrat Joe Biden is the winner of the Presidential race, but down ballot, the Republicans appear to have made important gains. We’re looking at the prospect of divided government – a Biden Administration with a Republican Senate and a Democratic House with a stronger minority. According to JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, this may be the best possible outcome.“A GOP senate majority should ensure that Trump’s pro-business policies stay intact, and if Biden is confirmed we should be able to expect an easing of the trade war, which should boost global trade and corporate earnings growth,” Kolanovic noted.With investor fears allayed – that the Democrats would roll back Trump-era tax policy or focus on aggressive bureaucratic regulation – Kolanovic believes the markets are primed for gains.However, finding the right stock to buy is always a challenge, even in a bullish environment, but TipRanks offers investors the range of metrics necessary to sort through the raw data of the markets and bring those nuggets to light. These include the analyst consensus rating, the upside potential, and the Smart Score; each gives a data point for investors, and taken together, when they all align, they’ll make a powerful signal.The analyst consensus is just that – an average derived from full range of analyst ratings. The upside potential comes from the stock’s collected price targets; it’s a mathematical average that suggests the stock’s possible growth on a one-year time horizon. And the Smart Score uses known predictive factors of market success to give stocks a score that points toward forward performance. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three stocks that check all three of these boxes. Pacific Ethanol (PEIX)We’ll start with a diversified company, with production lines in food products and animal feeds as well as industrial alcohols and renewable fuels. Pacific Ethanol sells its products on the global market, and has seen major gains in 2Q20. Even with recent losses in account, the stock is up a whopping 795% this year.The gains have come since July, as the company expanded production in response to demand for sanitizing alcohols. Sales of alcohol for hand sanitizers has been a major boost for the Pacific Ethanol in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Taking new production and sales potential into account, the company has revised 2020 earnings estimates upward to the $66 million to $86 million range.So far, the company is on track. Like many small-cap manufacturers, Pacific Ethanol was running earnings deficits prior to this year – but COVID-19 changed that. Earnings turned positive in Q2 and remained so in Q3. The sudden shift has investors bullish on the stock.Amit Dayal, 5-star analyst with H.C. Wainwright, sees plenty of reason for an upbeat outlook here. “Investors should note that management indicated that though the company has a firm visibility on pricing, specialty alcohol volumes delivered to customers could vary on a quarterly basis. Given that sanitizers are a key end-market for specialty alcohols, the stock has come under some pressure with positive COVID-19 vaccine related news. However, we believe demand for sanitizer products should remain elevated with increase in any economic activity in the near term. We believe the improved balance sheet and cash flow is allowing the company to make investments in areas of the business that have been previously overlooked, and may have been under-contributing as a result,” Dayal opined.In-line with these comments, Dayal rates this stock a Buy along with a $16 price target. This figure suggests an impressive 174% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here)All three of the recent reviews on PEIX are positive, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. PEIX shares are priced at $5.82 and have been growing fast in 2H20, but the Street expects to see more growth here; the average price target is $16.50, implying 183% growth ahead for Pacific Ethanol. (See PEIX stock analysis on TipRanks)New York Times Company (NYT)Our next stock is a storied name in the publishing world. The New York Times company owns its eponymous newspaper, along with an array of other media assets and Times-related brands. The company boasts a $6.4 billion market cap and upwards of 30 business assets. Its core brands attract 150 million readers every month, and over 6.5 million paid subscriptions.In a news environment as fast-paced and chaotic as 2020 has been, the NYT has reaped the benefit of people’s need to know. The stock is up 20% year-to-date, despite some slips in recent weeks.Covering NYT for J.P. Morgan, analyst Alexia Quadrani writes, “NYT remains our favorite midcap stock, and we see the growth story for digital subs continuing and will very likely reach 10m well ahead of management’s 2025 target. ARPU and margin improvements over time will also make the stock look cheaper on earnings, which will negate the pushback on valuation. While shares could remain a bit more range bound near term until we get more visibility into trends in 2021, we view the sell-off today as creating an attractive entry point.”Quadrani rates this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her $50 price target indicates a potential for 30% in the next 12 months. (To watch Quadrani’s track record, click here)The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on NYT is unanimous, and based on 4 recent reviews. Shares have an average price target of $53, suggesting a 37% one-year upside from the current trading price of $38.53. (See NYT stock analysis on TipRanks)Thor Industries (THO)Last but not least is Thor Industries, a major manufacturer of recreational vehicles. RVs are a popular form of leisure, and have seen a modest gain during the ‘corona time,’ as there are compatible with social distancing requirements while still permitting households to vacation together. Thor owns seven brands, including well-known names like Airstream and Heartland. The company has a $4.8 billion market cap and upwards of $8 billion in annual revenues.Quarterly revenues, which were reported for Q3 earlier this month, have recovered from a short dip earlier this year. The Q3 top line came in at $2.32 billion, the highest of the past four quarters. Earnings, which has been falling since Q3 of last year, showed a massive sequential spike, jumping from 43 cents per share to $2.14. Leisure stocks have been seeing a resurgence recently, and BMO Capital analyst Gerrick Johnson has been reviewing the sector. Of Thor Industries, Johnson writes, “Stocks of leisure companies usually move higher or lower on retail sales results more so than revenues or EPS. We think investor focus will shift after this quarter. Retail has caught up with investor expectations… We think … Thor (THO) will have the longest legs in terms of consumer demand…” Turning to sales numbers, Johnson adds, “Last quarter, management sounded very optimistic about FY2021 and expects the current robust retail and restocking cycle will last through at least the end of its fiscal year.”To this end, Johnson rates THO an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $110 price target implies an upside of 26% from current levels. (To watch Johnson’s track record, click here)Once again, we are looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating; Thor has 4 recent Buy reviews. The stock also has a $115 average price target, which suggests a bullish 32% upside for the next 12 months.

Shares of the fuel cell company are up more than 5x from their price at the start of the year, and now trade at nearly 22 times trailing sales, and 34 times book value, despite a total lack of profitability.This doesn't concern H.C Wainwright's Amit Dayal, however. In a note published following Plug's Q3 2020 earnings results, the analyst argues that Plug Power's valuation is really all about the future -- a future as far off as 2024... or even 2030.Plug Power, you see, may not be earning profits right now. But Plug management has repeatedly promised in recent quarters (and repeated the promise on Monday) that in 2024 it will earn $200 million in operating profit and record ""gross billings"" of $1.2 billion.Now, ""gross billings"" aren't a financial metric often recited by publicly traded companies. To translate the term into something more familiar to investors, therefore, Dayal calculates that Plug's revenues in 2024 will be about $1.1 billion -- more than four times the company's trailing revenues currently. Dayal further projects that by 2030, Plug will grow this number even further -- to $7.4 billion in annual sales. And if this number is correct, says Dayal, the company will achieve a 10-year compounded revenue growth rate in excess of 38%.That's a staggering sum, but in fact, it's not entirely unrealistic. In fact, over the past five years alone, Plug has grown its revenues at about a 29% compounded rate. While acceleration to 38% certainly won't be easy, Plug's history of revenue growth suggests it does lie within the realm of possibility.And yet, that's not really the point, is it? The point of a profit-seeking venture like Plug should in theory be not just to ""sell stuff,"" but to earn profits from selling stuff -- and it's here that Plug Power has historically fallen short. In Q3 2020 for example, Plug grew its sales 80% (so twice as fast as Dayal's projected sales growth rate). Problem was, the company also doubled its net loss on those sales, from $18.2 million a year ago, to $39.4 million in Q3.Despite this huge Q3 loss, and despite Plug's unbroken history of similar losses, Dayal insists that Plug's rapid sales growth will eventually bring the company to profitability -- indeed, he projects net profits by 2023, which is even sooner than Plug is promising. With this prospect in mind, he has reiterated his ""buy"" rating on Plug Power stock, and doubled his price target $30. (To watch Dayal's track record, click here)All in all, Plug's strong share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the consensus price target. Shares are selling for $23, and the average target of $20.89 implies a 9% downside. Paradoxically, the stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys and no Holds or Sells.

1,Doctors are seeing patients online during coronavirus â€” and it could change medicine forever,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/doctors-are-seeing-patients-online-during-coronavirus-%E2%80%94-and-it-could-change-medicine-forever/ar-BB12eGhx,"Michael Jara, 7, showed up for his regular physical therapy appointment in Virginia Beach on Wednesday, feeling a bit shy but excited to move around for an hour.He greeted physical therapist Lindsey Pauley with a smile and a wave, his mother standing nearby.They started with some movement to warm up — frog jumps, inch worms, crab walks — then did yoga together before working on the exercises he’d done dozens of times before.“Alright, big jumps!” Pauley said as she watched him squat and hop like a frog, guiding him to do the exercises correctly. “Don’t go too fast! Slow down!”There was one difference between this appointment and the ones Michael had been attending twice weekly for the past six months: Instead of being inside Southeastern Physical Therapy’s colorful gym, surrounded by exercise balls and hopscotch mats, he was in the carpeted hallway of his house nearby, following Pauley’s instructions via a live video on a phone screen.Telehealth has rapidly taken off in hundreds of health care offices since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the United States, forcing people to isolate at home instead of taking a risk for a routine visit to the doctor. Practices like Southeastern Physical Therapy, which had planned to slowly pilot a telemedicine program over the next year or so, have had to quickly ramp up the offering as an option for those no longer able to leave their house.Health care workers report seeing patient benefits beyond simply being able to avoid others to stop the spread of a virus, and many predict the use of telemedicine post-pandemic will be widespread.“I think that the practice of medicine as it was in 2019 has completely changed,” said Dr. Mark Haggerty, a family medicine doctor in Virginia Beach. “The future of medicine will probably in some significant part include virtual care. I think we were already seeing a move toward that, and this has simply accelerated that. We poured gas on the fire for sure.”Ramping upBefore March, the average daily number of telehealth visits within the Sentara Medical Group was around 20. Now, it’s more than 2,000, and more than 16,000 telehealth appointments have been held since March 17.Haggerty, who also serves as Sentara’s associate medical director of virtual care, said what would’ve been a six-week rollout of offering telemedicine in one practice was done in a week with 1,200 Sentara medical providers. Physicians learned how to use the software and were given a virtual care playbook with lessons such as proper video etiquette and expressing empathy and emotion without touch.“Everyone in Sentara has basically dropped everything and put full force into this program,” he said.Now, 90% to 95% of his patients are seen remotely to manage chronic conditions or diagnose acute illnesses. Beyond becoming a solution to avoiding the spread of coronavirus, Haggerty said telehealth is a useful tool for patients with limited mobility, those who live far away, and busy adults who can’t easily take off work or find child care.He expects telehealth to be used more frequently for those patients even after the coronavirus is no longer forcing people to stay home, but there will still be times patients must come in for a visit — if a doctor feels they need to physically see the person to give a diagnosis, for example.Loosening the rulesThe restrictions around who can use telehealth have been simplified since the pandemic began. Providers are now reimbursed for virtual care at the same rate as in-person visits. Through a waiver, Medicare now also covers telehealth visits, at least through the duration of the pandemic. Before the waiver, telehealth was only covered in a designated rural area and if the patient received telehealth services at a medical facility. Many insurance companies are also waiving copays and deductibles for telehealth appointments.More professions are now able to offer telehealth — dietitians, social workers, clinical psychologists, physical therapists and speech specialists among them.And health care workers won’t be penalized for using their personal cellphones to hold telehealth appointments, nor for using apps like FaceTime, Zoom, Skype or Facebook Messenger. Telehealth can now be used across state lines as well.Congress set aside $200 million as part of its federal coronavirus relief package for health care workers to add the broadband and technology necessary to provide telehealth services. Health care providers can apply for funding through the Federal Communications Commission.Limited broadband access remains a problem for many rural communities wishing to receive care via telemedicine. The state estimates about 660,000 homes and businesses lack access to a high-quality broadband connection.A lack of specialty health care is also a problem in rural areas. Dr. Tina Gustin and Dr. Carolyn Rutledge have been pushing doctors to collaborate via telehealth, so a patient visiting their primary care physician in a rural county can see a specialist remotely.Gustin and Rutledge, co-directors at the Center for Telehealth Innovation, Education, and Research at Old Dominion University’s School of Nursing, have been teaching providers how to establish successful telehealth programs and have had a noticeable uptick in demand for consulting services over the past few weeks.“If you talk to anybody that knows anything about policy change, they’ll tell you nothing has happened as rapidly as this has happened in the last three weeks,” Gustin said.The doctors developed a telehealth curriculum at ODU in 2012, and, thanks to federal grants, the program grew to teach more medical students across disciplines and universities, including Eastern Virginia Medical School and Virginia Wesleyan University. They’ve also launched a video series on telehealth etiquette and diagnosis techniques.Skyping with bunniesTelehealth has even gone beyond human medicine and into the animal kingdom.Dr. Sarah Middlebrooks, a veterinarian at Pet Care Veterinary Hospital in Virginia Beach, said that, in addition to curbside service — where the vet takes the pet inside while the owner stays in the car — she is now holding telemedicine appointments, mostly for follow-ups.“It’s really great if a pet owner has a concern that is not emergent,” Middlebrooks said. “It just gives them a peace of mind without ever having to leave their house.”So far, she’s held virtual appointments with cats and dogs, and even one bunny, and she’s received a lot of questions about whether pets can get coronavirus (there’s no evidence they can, though the virus can linger on the pet’s fur just like any surface).She said one disadvantage is being unable to check the animal’s vitals, a problem doctors for humans face as well.Dr. Eric Madren, a Bayview Physicians Group family doctor with Volvo Medical Associates in Chesapeake, said nurses have gotten creative to check patients’ vitals. They’ll ask patients to weigh themselves on their bathroom scale and teach them how to count their heart rate, and parents can measure their child’s length and head circumference.Madren has been able to maintain his care for most of his patients through telehealth, usually seeing about 20 to 25 people per day on the Zoom app.Telehealth also requires thinking outside the box, especially for those physicians who use equipment to help strengthen and heal patients.Maricel Briones, another physical therapist who works with adults at Southeastern Physical Therapy, said she often has her patients use soup cans as weights or dog leashes instead of TheraBands for stretching.At Michael’s physical therapy appointment, a broomstick is substituted for a taped line on the ground that he can hop over, and a balance disk is replaced by a pillow he can stand on with one foot.Pauley, his physical therapist, said while it’s less than ideal to not see kids like Michael in person, it’s helpful they can still rely on seeing her every week during uncertain times.“I really am happy to be able to see my kids and know that they are doing OK, and still give them that small sense of normalcy when everything is literally flipped upside down for them,” she said.Marie Albiges, 757-247-4962, malbiges@dailypress.com———©2020 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)Visit The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.) at pilotonline.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Like us on Facebook to see similar storiesPlease give an overall site rating:"

Tony Evers to simplify license renewals for health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, encourage retired workers to return to the job and expand the practice of some workers could ease the burden on the health care system, worker groups say.Advance practice nurses, such as nurse practitioners and certified registered nurse anesthetists, will be able to work more independently and in more places because of the order, Gina Bryan, chairwoman of the Wisconsin APRN Coalition, said Monday.“Allowing (advance practice nurses) to practice to the full scope of our training, education and experience will immediately increase access to care by increasing the sites and communities (advance practice nurses) can work within,” Bryan said.“As the number of COVID-19 patients continue to rise, so will the need for more nurses to provide care in our hospitals, long-term care facilities, home care and public health settings,” said Pamela Macari Sanberg, president of the Wisconsin Nurses Association. “(The order) will help fill some gaps that we anticipate will occur as a result of the virus.”Evers and state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm on Friday signed the order to beef up the health care workforce to address COVID-19 and the many other medical conditions that still require attention, such as cancer and injuries.“This action will ensure that more Wisconsinites get the care they need, when they need it,” Evers said in a statement.The order eliminates some late renewal fees for people whose licenses have lapsed and allows the state Department of Safety and Professional Services to eliminate some credentialing requirements, such as continuing education.“We have heard from many providers who are eager to return to practice and help respond to the COVID-19 crisis,” DSPS Secretary Dawn Crim said. “Other providers want the flexibility to go where the need is greatest and respond as fully and efficiently as possible.”The order allows licensed out-of-state practitioners to practice in Wisconsin without first requiring an in-state credential, and eliminates time limits for temporary licenses, Evers said. It allows nursing students near graduation to help with COVID-19 by adjusting clinical education requirements.The order also suspends restrictions for advanced practice nurses and provides more flexibility to physician assistants. For example, doctors can now supervise up to eight physician assistants at a time, compared to four previously.Physicians assistants “are uniquely qualified to respond to the (COVID-19) crisis given our flexibility across the specialties,” said Julie Doyle, president of the Wisconsin Academy of Physician Assistants. “All PAs are trained in emergency and hospital medicine as well as primary care.”The order, which started Friday, will remain in effect through the duration of the public health emergency, Evers said.Sign up now to get the most recent coronavirus headlines and other important local and national news sent to your email inbox daily.David Wahlberg is the health and medicine reporter for the Wisconsin State Journal.""We are literally reinventing a college in a matter of days and building systems in a matter of hours,"" the college's provost said.As the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues to grow in the U.S. and elsewhere, researchers in Madison and around the world are racing to come up with medical measures to stop it.A UW School of Medicine and Public Health fund plans to award $1.5 million in grants for projects that help lessen the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wisconsin.Madison hospitals are creating separate units in their emergency rooms for COVID-19 patients and adding negative air pressure rooms to protect people in other areas.Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device."

Alibaba owns a third of Ant, which was also co-founded by Ma.Ram Parameswaran, Octahedron’s founder, expects Ant to resume its IPO and is holding onto Alibaba shares despite China’s unveiling of new anti-monopoly rules.“It’s one of the cheapest commerce businesses in the world if you use a reasonable sum-of-the-parts valuation framework,” Parameswaran said. “There’s lots of monetization runway in the core business with live streaming and recommendation engines.”Despite a slowdown, Alibaba’s revenue is still increasing at least 20% per quarter, while its cloud unit is on track to become profitable for the first time in the year through March. Its Cainiao delivery network is also expanding at its fastest pace on record, boosted by cross-border trade.Coronation CapitalThe Hong Kong-based family office bought more shares of Alibaba after they tumbled on Wednesday and is planning to increase total exposure to about 3% from 0.5% over time.“Alibaba is still going to be a trillion-dollar company in the future,” said founding partner Jin Zi, whose firm manages about $300 million of assets. “Yes, the company is going to come under pressure in the next three-to-five months, but we are investing for the next three-to-five years, and we don’t think other competitors can topple Alibaba.”Kamet CapitalThe family office has been trimming its position in Alibaba, which is one of its largest investments. But it’s still retaining some exposure because Alibaba is highly correlated to a rebounding Chinese economy.The firm’s next moves will depend on how China’s recovery holds up and how policy makers implement the new anti-monopoly rules, said Kerry Goh, the firm’s Singapore-based chief investment officer.“Alibaba will be under pressure,” Goh said. “We want to see how the regulatory pressure balances out the economic recovery.”Commonwealth Avenue Asset ManagementThe macro-oriented investor has confidence that Chinese regulators know what they’re doing and that Ant will likely list within a year from now, albeit at a lower valuation.“Alibaba will still get benefits from the listing,” said Chong Sze King, the firm’s managing director in Singapore. “We think it’s a good time to buy.”Long Corridor Asset ManagementThe Hong Kong-based hedge fund, which oversees about $200 million, boosted its Alibaba position by one-third after the Ant IPO was pulled, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is private.Ali Sheikh, Long Corridor’s chief operating officer, declined to comment.(Updates with Alibaba share price in first and second graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman had his best trade of all-time earlier this year when he bet against the market, and he's  placing a similar bet again despite the market optimism surrounding the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.What Happened: Business Insider reports that Bill Ackman placed a new hedge against the market Monday.The news came on the same day Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) announced a 90% efficacy rate for their COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The desire to know where you land in the sea of retirement savers…It’s been said that gridlock is a feature, not a bug, of the US Constitution, and we may be about to find that out. The election results have left some questions to be resolved, but a few things are coming clear: Democrat Joe Biden is the winner of the Presidential race, but down ballot, the Republicans appear to have made important gains. We’re looking at the prospect of divided government – a Biden Administration with a Republican Senate and a Democratic House with a stronger minority. According to JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, this may be the best possible outcome.“A GOP senate majority should ensure that Trump’s pro-business policies stay intact, and if Biden is confirmed we should be able to expect an easing of the trade war, which should boost global trade and corporate earnings growth,” Kolanovic noted.With investor fears allayed – that the Democrats would roll back Trump-era tax policy or focus on aggressive bureaucratic regulation – Kolanovic believes the markets are primed for gains.However, finding the right stock to buy is always a challenge, even in a bullish environment, but TipRanks offers investors the range of metrics necessary to sort through the raw data of the markets and bring those nuggets to light. These include the analyst consensus rating, the upside potential, and the Smart Score; each gives a data point for investors, and taken together, when they all align, they’ll make a powerful signal.The analyst consensus is just that – an average derived from full range of analyst ratings. The upside potential comes from the stock’s collected price targets; it’s a mathematical average that suggests the stock’s possible growth on a one-year time horizon. And the Smart Score uses known predictive factors of market success to give stocks a score that points toward forward performance. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three stocks that check all three of these boxes. Pacific Ethanol (PEIX)We’ll start with a diversified company, with production lines in food products and animal feeds as well as industrial alcohols and renewable fuels. Pacific Ethanol sells its products on the global market, and has seen major gains in 2Q20. Even with recent losses in account, the stock is up a whopping 795% this year.The gains have come since July, as the company expanded production in response to demand for sanitizing alcohols. Sales of alcohol for hand sanitizers has been a major boost for the Pacific Ethanol in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Taking new production and sales potential into account, the company has revised 2020 earnings estimates upward to the $66 million to $86 million range.So far, the company is on track. Like many small-cap manufacturers, Pacific Ethanol was running earnings deficits prior to this year – but COVID-19 changed that. Earnings turned positive in Q2 and remained so in Q3. The sudden shift has investors bullish on the stock.Amit Dayal, 5-star analyst with H.C. Wainwright, sees plenty of reason for an upbeat outlook here. “Investors should note that management indicated that though the company has a firm visibility on pricing, specialty alcohol volumes delivered to customers could vary on a quarterly basis. Given that sanitizers are a key end-market for specialty alcohols, the stock has come under some pressure with positive COVID-19 vaccine related news. However, we believe demand for sanitizer products should remain elevated with increase in any economic activity in the near term. We believe the improved balance sheet and cash flow is allowing the company to make investments in areas of the business that have been previously overlooked, and may have been under-contributing as a result,” Dayal opined.In-line with these comments, Dayal rates this stock a Buy along with a $16 price target. This figure suggests an impressive 174% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here)All three of the recent reviews on PEIX are positive, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. PEIX shares are priced at $5.82 and have been growing fast in 2H20, but the Street expects to see more growth here; the average price target is $16.50, implying 183% growth ahead for Pacific Ethanol. (See PEIX stock analysis on TipRanks)New York Times Company (NYT)Our next stock is a storied name in the publishing world. The New York Times company owns its eponymous newspaper, along with an array of other media assets and Times-related brands. The company boasts a $6.4 billion market cap and upwards of 30 business assets. Its core brands attract 150 million readers every month, and over 6.5 million paid subscriptions.In a news environment as fast-paced and chaotic as 2020 has been, the NYT has reaped the benefit of people’s need to know. The stock is up 20% year-to-date, despite some slips in recent weeks.Covering NYT for J.P. Morgan, analyst Alexia Quadrani writes, “NYT remains our favorite midcap stock, and we see the growth story for digital subs continuing and will very likely reach 10m well ahead of management’s 2025 target. ARPU and margin improvements over time will also make the stock look cheaper on earnings, which will negate the pushback on valuation. While shares could remain a bit more range bound near term until we get more visibility into trends in 2021, we view the sell-off today as creating an attractive entry point.”Quadrani rates this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her $50 price target indicates a potential for 30% in the next 12 months. (To watch Quadrani’s track record, click here)The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on NYT is unanimous, and based on 4 recent reviews. Shares have an average price target of $53, suggesting a 37% one-year upside from the current trading price of $38.53. (See NYT stock analysis on TipRanks)Thor Industries (THO)Last but not least is Thor Industries, a major manufacturer of recreational vehicles. RVs are a popular form of leisure, and have seen a modest gain during the ‘corona time,’ as there are compatible with social distancing requirements while still permitting households to vacation together. Thor owns seven brands, including well-known names like Airstream and Heartland. The company has a $4.8 billion market cap and upwards of $8 billion in annual revenues.Quarterly revenues, which were reported for Q3 earlier this month, have recovered from a short dip earlier this year. The Q3 top line came in at $2.32 billion, the highest of the past four quarters. Earnings, which has been falling since Q3 of last year, showed a massive sequential spike, jumping from 43 cents per share to $2.14. Leisure stocks have been seeing a resurgence recently, and BMO Capital analyst Gerrick Johnson has been reviewing the sector. Of Thor Industries, Johnson writes, “Stocks of leisure companies usually move higher or lower on retail sales results more so than revenues or EPS. We think investor focus will shift after this quarter. Retail has caught up with investor expectations… We think … Thor (THO) will have the longest legs in terms of consumer demand…” Turning to sales numbers, Johnson adds, “Last quarter, management sounded very optimistic about FY2021 and expects the current robust retail and restocking cycle will last through at least the end of its fiscal year.”To this end, Johnson rates THO an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $110 price target implies an upside of 26% from current levels. (To watch Johnson’s track record, click here)Once again, we are looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating; Thor has 4 recent Buy reviews. The stock also has a $115 average price target, which suggests a bullish 32% upside for the next 12 months.

We recently asked over 1,000 Benzinga investors and traders which electric vehicle maker's stock has the most room to grow between now and 2025.Over the next five years, which stock will have the largest percentage gain: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) or Nio (NYSE: NIO)?Tesla Vs. Nio StockBased on third-quarter earnings data, Elon Musk's Tesla remains on track and has the capacity to top its goal of 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020.On Oct. 21, the company reported third-quarter revenue of .77 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 39%. Revenue for the Palo Alto-based EV manufacturer came in higher than estimates of $8.26 billion. The sum of all automotive sales revenue for Tesla was $7.6 billion.Meanwhile, with second-quarter revenue of $526.3 million, higher by 139.54% from the same period last year, Shanghai-based EV maker Nio continues to garner investor's attention in the EV space.Be sure to follow Benzinga for Nio's third-quarter earnings, expected Nov. 17 after market close.Levels of sentiment were extraordinarily tight for this study as traders and investors expressed an near-equal weighted confidence for both EV makers.49.2% of respondents said Tesla stock will grow the most by 2025.

If the fund is owned inside a tax-favored account like an IRA or retirement account, the sale will not generate a taxable gain.Plug Power (PLUG) is a strange sort of business. In more than 20 years of operation, the hydrogen fuel cell company has sold a lot of fuel cell systems, but never earned a profit, and never generated positive free cash flow. Instead, Plug funds its operations mainly by issuing and selling new shares -- over and over again. In fact, from 2000 to 2020, Plug's share count has grown from 4.4 million to 399.7 million -- i.e. grown 90x in size.But what a difference a pandemic makes, and what a difference (the hope for) a Green New Deal!As COVID-19 unhinged stock markets from ordinary rules for valuation, and the prospect of a Democratic ""Blue Wave"" showering taxpayer dollars all over the renewable energy industry, Plug Power stock has gone on a tear. Shares of the fuel cell company are up more than 5x from their price at the start of the year, and now trade at nearly 22 times trailing sales, and 34 times book value, despite a total lack of profitability.This doesn't concern H.C Wainwright's Amit Dayal, however. In a note published following Plug's Q3 2020 earnings results, the analyst argues that Plug Power's valuation is really all about the future -- a future as far off as 2024... or even 2030.Plug Power, you see, may not be earning profits right now. But Plug management has repeatedly promised in recent quarters (and repeated the promise on Monday) that in 2024 it will earn $200 million in operating profit and record ""gross billings"" of $1.2 billion.Now, ""gross billings"" aren't a financial metric often recited by publicly traded companies. To translate the term into something more familiar to investors, therefore, Dayal calculates that Plug's revenues in 2024 will be about $1.1 billion -- more than four times the company's trailing revenues currently. Dayal further projects that by 2030, Plug will grow this number even further -- to $7.4 billion in annual sales. And if this number is correct, says Dayal, the company will achieve a 10-year compounded revenue growth rate in excess of 38%.That's a staggering sum, but in fact, it's not entirely unrealistic. In fact, over the past five years alone, Plug has grown its revenues at about a 29% compounded rate. While acceleration to 38% certainly won't be easy, Plug's history of revenue growth suggests it does lie within the realm of possibility.And yet, that's not really the point, is it? The point of a profit-seeking venture like Plug should in theory be not just to ""sell stuff,"" but to earn profits from selling stuff -- and it's here that Plug Power has historically fallen short. In Q3 2020 for example, Plug grew its sales 80% (so twice as fast as Dayal's projected sales growth rate). Problem was, the company also doubled its net loss on those sales, from $18.2 million a year ago, to $39.4 million in Q3.Despite this huge Q3 loss, and despite Plug's unbroken history of similar losses, Dayal insists that Plug's rapid sales growth will eventually bring the company to profitability -- indeed, he projects net profits by 2023, which is even sooner than Plug is promising. With this prospect in mind, he has reiterated his ""buy"" rating on Plug Power stock, and doubled his price target $30. (To watch Dayal's track record, click here)All in all, Plug's strong share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the consensus price target. Shares are selling for $23, and the average target of $20.89 implies a 9% downside. Paradoxically, the stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys and no Holds or Sells.

1,Medtronic Launches New Solutions to Help Monitor Patients for COVID-19,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-launches-solutions-help-monitor-120010238.html,"New Offerings Available to Existing Medtronic Care Management Services Customers as well as New Hospital Systems, Health Plans and EmployersDUBLIN, March 27, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Medtronic plc (MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today announced its Medtronic Care Management Services (MCMS) business is launching two new solutions designed to help assess, monitor, and triage support for patients who may be concerned about COVID-19 and their respiratory symptoms. It has already launched its new Respiratory Infectious Disease Health Check to existing MCMS customers, and it is now launching a new COVID-19 Virtual Care Evaluation and Monitoring solution available to U.S. health systems, health plans and employers.“With the rapid spread of COVID-19, we know that alternative approaches to screening, disease monitoring, and patient education are urgently needed to reduce additional population exposure to the virus and ease the burden on health care providers and facilities. It’s easy to understand why staying in self-quarantine and monitoring your own symptoms is challenging. Unless you consult a medical professional, it’s hard to know when your symptoms warrant seeking medical care,” said Sheri Dodd, vice president and general manager of MCMS. “Using technology for self-reported symptom monitoring may play an important role in slowing the spread of the disease and helping escalate patient needs to their provider when appropriate.”The Respiratory Infectious Disease Health Check for existing MCMS customers is an included add-on to all current care management programs. The Respiratory Infectious Disease Health Check helps patients with chronic, co-morbid health conditions who are at the highest risk for complications or mortality associated with COVID-19 track their respiratory infectious disease symptoms and body temperature through daily health checks. The program reacts dynamically during the health check to present symptom questions based on the patient’s previous responses, and provides patient education to encourage and support self-care. Data is aggregated for clinician review and action if additional intervention is needed.For health systems, health plans and other employers new to MCMS programs, the company is launching a stand-alone assessment and monitoring service. The COVID-19 Virtual Care Evaluation and Monitoring solution uses a virtual assistant to evaluate patients through a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline-based survey for COVID-19 symptoms. If the user’s symptoms warrant it, the solution connects them to the MCMS nurse command center, where registered nurses review the patient’s data and either identify recommendations or the need for additional care assessment, based on the CDC guidelines. This could include a recommendation to continue monitoring symptoms at home, or to contact a healthcare provider directly.“True to the Medtronic Mission, the health and safety of our customers, their patients, and our employees remains our highest priority as we address this unprecedented outbreak,” says John Liddicoat, M.D., executive vice president and president, Medtronic Americas Region. “Around the world, we are in ongoing communication with customers, suppliers, and governments to prioritize needs to the best of our ability. These solutions aim to help manage unnecessary exposures, minimize burden on the health care system, and escalate the most seriously ill patients for immediate care.”About Medtronic Care Management Services (MCMS)Medtronic Care Management Services (www.medtronic.com/caremanagementservices) offers remote patient monitoring that uses a combination of care management services, patient engagement solutions, and data analytics and reporting. MCMS helps health plans, ACOs, IDNs, and home health agencies focus their care on at-risk patients with actionable insights.

Alibaba owns a third of Ant, which was also co-founded by Ma.Ram Parameswaran, Octahedron’s founder, expects Ant to resume its IPO and is holding onto Alibaba shares despite China’s unveiling of new anti-monopoly rules.“It’s one of the cheapest commerce businesses in the world if you use a reasonable sum-of-the-parts valuation framework,” Parameswaran said. “There’s lots of monetization runway in the core business with live streaming and recommendation engines.”Despite a slowdown, Alibaba’s revenue is still increasing at least 20% per quarter, while its cloud unit is on track to become profitable for the first time in the year through March. Its Cainiao delivery network is also expanding at its fastest pace on record, boosted by cross-border trade.Coronation CapitalThe Hong Kong-based family office bought more shares of Alibaba after they tumbled on Wednesday and is planning to increase total exposure to about 3% from 0.5% over time.“Alibaba is still going to be a trillion-dollar company in the future,” said founding partner Jin Zi, whose firm manages about $300 million of assets. “Yes, the company is going to come under pressure in the next three-to-five months, but we are investing for the next three-to-five years, and we don’t think other competitors can topple Alibaba.”Kamet CapitalThe family office has been trimming its position in Alibaba, which is one of its largest investments. But it’s still retaining some exposure because Alibaba is highly correlated to a rebounding Chinese economy.The firm’s next moves will depend on how China’s recovery holds up and how policy makers implement the new anti-monopoly rules, said Kerry Goh, the firm’s Singapore-based chief investment officer.“Alibaba will be under pressure,” Goh said. “We want to see how the regulatory pressure balances out the economic recovery.”Commonwealth Avenue Asset ManagementThe macro-oriented investor has confidence that Chinese regulators know what they’re doing and that Ant will likely list within a year from now, albeit at a lower valuation.“Alibaba will still get benefits from the listing,” said Chong Sze King, the firm’s managing director in Singapore. “We think it’s a good time to buy.”Long Corridor Asset ManagementThe Hong Kong-based hedge fund, which oversees about $200 million, boosted its Alibaba position by one-third after the Ant IPO was pulled, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is private.Ali Sheikh, Long Corridor’s chief operating officer, declined to comment.(Updates with Alibaba share price in first and second graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman had his best trade of all-time earlier this year when he bet against the market, and he's  placing a similar bet again despite the market optimism surrounding the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.What Happened: Business Insider reports that Bill Ackman placed a new hedge against the market Monday.The news came on the same day Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) announced a 90% efficacy rate for their COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The desire to know where you land in the sea of retirement savers…It’s been said that gridlock is a feature, not a bug, of the US Constitution, and we may be about to find that out. The election results have left some questions to be resolved, but a few things are coming clear: Democrat Joe Biden is the winner of the Presidential race, but down ballot, the Republicans appear to have made important gains. We’re looking at the prospect of divided government – a Biden Administration with a Republican Senate and a Democratic House with a stronger minority. According to JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, this may be the best possible outcome.“A GOP senate majority should ensure that Trump’s pro-business policies stay intact, and if Biden is confirmed we should be able to expect an easing of the trade war, which should boost global trade and corporate earnings growth,” Kolanovic noted.With investor fears allayed – that the Democrats would roll back Trump-era tax policy or focus on aggressive bureaucratic regulation – Kolanovic believes the markets are primed for gains.However, finding the right stock to buy is always a challenge, even in a bullish environment, but TipRanks offers investors the range of metrics necessary to sort through the raw data of the markets and bring those nuggets to light. These include the analyst consensus rating, the upside potential, and the Smart Score; each gives a data point for investors, and taken together, when they all align, they’ll make a powerful signal.The analyst consensus is just that – an average derived from full range of analyst ratings. The upside potential comes from the stock’s collected price targets; it’s a mathematical average that suggests the stock’s possible growth on a one-year time horizon. And the Smart Score uses known predictive factors of market success to give stocks a score that points toward forward performance. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three stocks that check all three of these boxes. Pacific Ethanol (PEIX)We’ll start with a diversified company, with production lines in food products and animal feeds as well as industrial alcohols and renewable fuels. Pacific Ethanol sells its products on the global market, and has seen major gains in 2Q20. Even with recent losses in account, the stock is up a whopping 795% this year.The gains have come since July, as the company expanded production in response to demand for sanitizing alcohols. Sales of alcohol for hand sanitizers has been a major boost for the Pacific Ethanol in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Taking new production and sales potential into account, the company has revised 2020 earnings estimates upward to the $66 million to $86 million range.So far, the company is on track. Like many small-cap manufacturers, Pacific Ethanol was running earnings deficits prior to this year – but COVID-19 changed that. Earnings turned positive in Q2 and remained so in Q3. The sudden shift has investors bullish on the stock.Amit Dayal, 5-star analyst with H.C. Wainwright, sees plenty of reason for an upbeat outlook here. “Investors should note that management indicated that though the company has a firm visibility on pricing, specialty alcohol volumes delivered to customers could vary on a quarterly basis. Given that sanitizers are a key end-market for specialty alcohols, the stock has come under some pressure with positive COVID-19 vaccine related news. However, we believe demand for sanitizer products should remain elevated with increase in any economic activity in the near term. We believe the improved balance sheet and cash flow is allowing the company to make investments in areas of the business that have been previously overlooked, and may have been under-contributing as a result,” Dayal opined.In-line with these comments, Dayal rates this stock a Buy along with a $16 price target. This figure suggests an impressive 174% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here)All three of the recent reviews on PEIX are positive, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. PEIX shares are priced at $5.82 and have been growing fast in 2H20, but the Street expects to see more growth here; the average price target is $16.50, implying 183% growth ahead for Pacific Ethanol. (See PEIX stock analysis on TipRanks)New York Times Company (NYT)Our next stock is a storied name in the publishing world. The New York Times company owns its eponymous newspaper, along with an array of other media assets and Times-related brands. The company boasts a $6.4 billion market cap and upwards of 30 business assets. Its core brands attract 150 million readers every month, and over 6.5 million paid subscriptions.In a news environment as fast-paced and chaotic as 2020 has been, the NYT has reaped the benefit of people’s need to know. The stock is up 20% year-to-date, despite some slips in recent weeks.Covering NYT for J.P. Morgan, analyst Alexia Quadrani writes, “NYT remains our favorite midcap stock, and we see the growth story for digital subs continuing and will very likely reach 10m well ahead of management’s 2025 target. ARPU and margin improvements over time will also make the stock look cheaper on earnings, which will negate the pushback on valuation. While shares could remain a bit more range bound near term until we get more visibility into trends in 2021, we view the sell-off today as creating an attractive entry point.”Quadrani rates this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her $50 price target indicates a potential for 30% in the next 12 months. (To watch Quadrani’s track record, click here)The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on NYT is unanimous, and based on 4 recent reviews. Shares have an average price target of $53, suggesting a 37% one-year upside from the current trading price of $38.53. (See NYT stock analysis on TipRanks)Thor Industries (THO)Last but not least is Thor Industries, a major manufacturer of recreational vehicles. RVs are a popular form of leisure, and have seen a modest gain during the ‘corona time,’ as there are compatible with social distancing requirements while still permitting households to vacation together. Thor owns seven brands, including well-known names like Airstream and Heartland. The company has a $4.8 billion market cap and upwards of $8 billion in annual revenues.Quarterly revenues, which were reported for Q3 earlier this month, have recovered from a short dip earlier this year. The Q3 top line came in at $2.32 billion, the highest of the past four quarters. Earnings, which has been falling since Q3 of last year, showed a massive sequential spike, jumping from 43 cents per share to $2.14. Leisure stocks have been seeing a resurgence recently, and BMO Capital analyst Gerrick Johnson has been reviewing the sector. Of Thor Industries, Johnson writes, “Stocks of leisure companies usually move higher or lower on retail sales results more so than revenues or EPS. We think investor focus will shift after this quarter. Retail has caught up with investor expectations… We think … Thor (THO) will have the longest legs in terms of consumer demand…” Turning to sales numbers, Johnson adds, “Last quarter, management sounded very optimistic about FY2021 and expects the current robust retail and restocking cycle will last through at least the end of its fiscal year.”To this end, Johnson rates THO an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $110 price target implies an upside of 26% from current levels. (To watch Johnson’s track record, click here)Once again, we are looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating; Thor has 4 recent Buy reviews. The stock also has a $115 average price target, which suggests a bullish 32% upside for the next 12 months.

Shares of the fuel cell company are up more than 5x from their price at the start of the year, and now trade at nearly 22 times trailing sales, and 34 times book value, despite a total lack of profitability.This doesn't concern H.C Wainwright's Amit Dayal, however. In a note published following Plug's Q3 2020 earnings results, the analyst argues that Plug Power's valuation is really all about the future -- a future as far off as 2024... or even 2030.Plug Power, you see, may not be earning profits right now. But Plug management has repeatedly promised in recent quarters (and repeated the promise on Monday) that in 2024 it will earn $200 million in operating profit and record ""gross billings"" of $1.2 billion.Now, ""gross billings"" aren't a financial metric often recited by publicly traded companies. To translate the term into something more familiar to investors, therefore, Dayal calculates that Plug's revenues in 2024 will be about $1.1 billion -- more than four times the company's trailing revenues currently. Dayal further projects that by 2030, Plug will grow this number even further -- to $7.4 billion in annual sales. And if this number is correct, says Dayal, the company will achieve a 10-year compounded revenue growth rate in excess of 38%.That's a staggering sum, but in fact, it's not entirely unrealistic. In fact, over the past five years alone, Plug has grown its revenues at about a 29% compounded rate. While acceleration to 38% certainly won't be easy, Plug's history of revenue growth suggests it does lie within the realm of possibility.And yet, that's not really the point, is it? The point of a profit-seeking venture like Plug should in theory be not just to ""sell stuff,"" but to earn profits from selling stuff -- and it's here that Plug Power has historically fallen short. In Q3 2020 for example, Plug grew its sales 80% (so twice as fast as Dayal's projected sales growth rate). Problem was, the company also doubled its net loss on those sales, from $18.2 million a year ago, to $39.4 million in Q3.Despite this huge Q3 loss, and despite Plug's unbroken history of similar losses, Dayal insists that Plug's rapid sales growth will eventually bring the company to profitability -- indeed, he projects net profits by 2023, which is even sooner than Plug is promising. With this prospect in mind, he has reiterated his ""buy"" rating on Plug Power stock, and doubled his price target $30. (To watch Dayal's track record, click here)All in all, Plug's strong share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the consensus price target. Shares are selling for $23, and the average target of $20.89 implies a 9% downside. Paradoxically, the stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys and no Holds or Sells.

At that point, the condition had already affected her fertility, leading her to freeze her eggs.
Roberts, who recently starred in the Netflix film Holidate, revealed this news in Cosmopolitan‘s December cover story. She was interviewed by her friend Stephanie Danler, the author of Sweetbitter. Roberts was 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the interview.
The actor told Danler that as an adult, having kids wasn’t at the top of her mind. But that changed a few years ago, when Roberts was diagnosed with endometriosis. The condition occurs when tissue similar to the lining of your uterus grows elsewhere in the body, causing symptoms like pelvic pain, pain during sex, and prolonged periods. 
“I always had debilitating cramps and periods, so bad that I would miss school and, later, have to cancel meetings,” Roberts said in the interview. “I mentioned this to my doctor, who didn’t look into it and sent me on my way because maybe I was being dramatic? In my late 20s, I just had a feeling I needed to switch to a female doctor. It was the best decision. She ran tests, sent me to a specialist. Finally, there was validation that I wasn’t being dramatic.”
Roberts’ experience of being brushed off by her first doctor is, unfortunately, all too common. Studies have shown that doctors don’t take women’s pain as seriously as men’s, a phenomenon called the gender pain gap. In Roberts’ case, this delay in diagnosis had a serious consequence: Her endo had progressed to the point where it was affecting her ability to get pregnant, “I was kind of stunned,” she shared. “It felt so permanent, and oddly, I felt like I had done something wrong.” 
How much endometrial tissue a person has, where it grows, and what surgeries are used to treat it can all play a role in how the condition affects fertility. Roberts said that talking about endo and fertility with other women helped her process the news. “All of a sudden, there was a new world of conversation about endometriosis, infertility, miscarriages, fear of having kids,” she told Danler. “I was so grateful to find out I was not alone in this. I hadn’t done anything ‘wrong’ after all.”
Roberts also told Cosmo that her doctor suggested she freeze her eggs. She was initially scared to do so, but she did go through with the procedure eventually, calling it “a difficult process.”
While egg freezing is expensive and not an option for everyone, many doctors suggest that people with endometriosis who think they may want to get pregnant later on look into it, especially if their endo is more severe. “The disease itself, as well as surgeries, threatens to diminish ovarian reserve, and therefore freezing eggs early on is a smart, proactive strategy,” Avner Hershlag, MD, chief of Northwell Health’s Center for Human Reproduction, previously told Refinery29. He added that once someone with endo does get pregnant, it’s usually a fairly uncomplicated pregnancy. 
Roberts ultimately got pregnant. “It sounds cheesy, but the moment that I stopped thinking about it, we got pregnant,” she said. But even then, she was apprehensive that something might go wrong, so she didn’t go public with the news. “I kept it to myself, my family, and my partner, not wanting to make grand plans if it wasn’t going to work out,” she said. “This pregnancy made me realise that the only plan you can have is that there is no plan.”

Twenty years later, sadly, this is still the case. The gender pain gap has fed into the gender health gap, which sees conditions affecting women and people with wombs go under-diagnosed and underfunded. Far from improving, the situation seems to be getting worse. 
Just last month, the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on endometriosis released data showing that it now takes, on average, eight years to be diagnosed with the condition. 
However, new research from two academics at Manchester Metropolitan University may have a solution. Dr Stella Bullo, a linguist, and Dr Jasmine Hearn, a psychologist, joined forces to investigate the language being used by women to describe their pain. 
They interviewed 21 women aged between 23 and 53 who suffer from endometriosis and found that all of them used powerful metaphors to describe their pain. They said things like “it feels like my womb is going to explode” and likened their pain to “a burning golf ball”. One woman said that the experience of endometriosis was like having “a machine stuck inside” her. 
It feels like somebody putting barbed wire through your belly button [and] around your pelvis and they’re twisting it and pulling it and all your insides are just being squeezed and sort of pushed and pulled and everything is just being twisted. And then they set fire to the barbed wire and it starts getting hot and everything’s just being squished inside you basically. JO

Metaphors, as George Lakoff and Mark Johnson wrote in Metaphors We Live By, “are capable of creating new understandings and, therefore, new realities.” The essence of this sort of language, they also said, is that it enables us to “understand and experience one kind of thing in terms of another.”
The work done by Dr Bullo (who herself has endometriosis) and Dr Hearn may, then, go some way to bridging women’s pain gap. They found that women are trying to explain how much pain they are in and that what might sound like an exaggeration is actually an attempt to describe the indescribable, to express the agony they are experiencing in a part of their body that they cannot see or touch because it is buried deep inside them.
The two women academics concluded: “This language was often an attempt to emphasise the urgency of pain and provoke emotional responses, care provision, empathy, and understanding from the listener (usually a doctor or healthcare worker).” 
This is the first study of its kind and Dr Bullo and Dr Hearn acknowledge that more research is needed but they believe that understanding how women are trying to communicate, express and explain their pain could go some way towards making sure they actually get the treatment they need in a timely fashion. 
The suffering experienced by women with endometriosis has been described by Dr Mathew Leonardi as similar to the impact that having cancer has on a patient’s quality of life. However, Dr Bullo and Dr Hearn believe that “if health professionals learned to understand the language used by women it could speed up what is typically a very long diagnosis time for endometriosis” and alleviate some of this suffering. As a first step, they’d like to see doctors and health practitioners acknowledge such expressions and then “explore them further in consultations to better understand women’s experiences of endometriosis pain.”
At the moment, this research has only looked at endometriosis pain but the results could be applied to women’s pain more broadly. When it comes to the gender pain gap, there can be no doubt that men and women are treated differently. One study, for instance, found that women in the emergency department who report having acute pain are less likely to be given opioid painkillers (the most effective type of painkiller) than men. Another study, conducted in 2014, found that once in A&E, women waited significantly longer to see a doctor and were less often classified as an urgent case. If women were really, truly listened to, perhaps all of this would change.

Right now, nothing is making waves quite like cica. 
Google searches for ‘cica cream’ in particular are rapidly growing and with the weather slowly becoming colder, it makes sense: cica is the ultimate winter skincare companion. But how does it work and which are the best cica skincare products to stock up on? 
Here’s absolutely everything you need to know about using cica in skincare.
What is cica cream?
“Cica is a ‘nickname’ for the skincare ingredient centella asiatica,” says Dr Elif Benar, dermatologist and founder of www.drelif.co.uk. “It is a green herb that originates from the parsley family, and the ingredient has been used in wound healing for over 3,000 years.” 
Dr Benar mentions that cica is commonly used in traditional Chinese and ayurvedic medicine but is booming in the ever-popular Korean skincare market, too. 
What does cica cream do for skin?
Dr Benar explains that cica contains certain chemicals which can help to decrease inflammation so it is especially beneficial for treating redness, puffiness and swelling. “It’s also packed with antioxidants,” says Dr Benar, which protect skin against environmental factors such as pollution, which can make skin appear dull and peppered with fine lines.
That’s not all though, as Dr Benar says that cica is an all-rounder. “Cica can give skin an antimicrobial boost,” so it reduces bacteria on the skin, which could otherwise potentially lead to spots and irritation. “Cica has also been known to help increase collagen production,” continues Dr Benar, “which is vital for wound healing and anti-ageing. Collagen can also help to reduce scarring.”
Which skin types will benefit most from cica cream?
“Cica is a botanical ingredient that can be tolerated by all skin types,” says Dr Benar, pointing out that it is known to be especially beneficial for sensitive or inflamed skin. This is why it is gaining traction right now, as winter weather combined with central heating can exacerbate dryness, irritation and redness. If you’re looking for something that soothes skin instantly, this is it.
How should you use cica cream in skincare?
Incorporating cica into your skincare routine couldn’t be easier. Dr Benar suggests choosing a moisturiser or serum which contains the ingredient – and the best part is that you can use it in both the morning and evening. “It will help with dry, ageing and sensitive skin especially,” says Dr Benar. 
Cica products are also useful after skin treatments. “For example chemical peels, laser treatments or microneedling as they can help the skin heal and take down any irritation and redness,” Dr Benar adds. If you regularly use exfoliating acids, such as lactic or glycolic acid, following up with cica cream is beneficial for keeping skin soft, smooth and free from irritation.
Are there any side effects of cica?
“Cica is safe for most people when applied to the skin and side effects are rare,” says Dr Benar, “but in some cases, it could potentially cause itching and redness. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop using the product immediately and consult a skin specialist or your GP.
What is the best cica cream?
R29 rates Kiehl’s Centella Sensitive Cica Cream, £38, for soothing dry, winter-ravaged skin and getting rid of flaky patches. While it is intensely moisturising, it is non-comedogenic so is less likely to clog pores and cause breakouts. 
If your skin is on the drier side, try Liz Earle’s Cica Restore Skin Paste, £29. The texture is quite thick and balmy, almost like a face mask. Let a thin layer sit on the skin for five minutes before massaging it in with your fingertips and blotting away with either a tissue or a damp, warm cloth for a pro facial experience. 
Glow Recipe’s Banana Soufflé Moisture Cream, £36, is also a really easy cica product to incorporate into your skincare routine. Apply a layer after cleansing in both the morning and evening. It’s light, gentle and absorbs quickly without leaving a residue on the skin.

(CBS4)– In a time when there is a shortage of personal protective gear for health care workers, some hospitals are getting innovative with their solutions. Each day, those on the front lines of coronavirus are faced with new challenges.(credit: Good Samaritan Hospital)“We’re not sure what exactly the future is going to be holding, but we’re prepared for anything,” explained Justin Schmiedel, Chief Operating Officer at Good Samaritan Hospital in Lafayette. “A lot of people use the term unprecedented when they talk about COVID-19, and I think that sums up the sentiment well.”While many hospitals and clinics are struggling to get the personal protective equipment (PPE) they need, supplies at Good Samaritan have been in good shape. However recently, they noticed some face shields of their PAPRs were cracking.“Those are used as protective gear for our associates when they’re treating patients with any illnesses that can be transmitted throughout the air,” Schmiedel said. “They were still safe to use by associates but they were causing issues with visibility.”(credit: Good Samaritan Hospital)When the hospital began to look for a solution, they found that companies are not currently selling replacement shields.“There was nothing available because everyone else is in the same situation, looking for the same type of material,” explained Brett Bunnell, Good Samaratin’s Director of Supply Chain. “We had to figure out how we’re going to do this ourselves.”Bunnell was able to find one sheet of the polycarbonate they needed, from a company in Denver called Port Plastics. With that, they were able to come up with a plan to rebuild the shields themselves.“Our facilities team found the correct cutting tools, to cut the visor. And then we are fortunate to actually have a team here that was already producing and making masks for us,” Burnell explained.(credit: Good Samaritan Hospital)RELATED: Latest Updates On The Coronavirus Outbreak In ColoradoThe team making masks was able to use an industrial sewing machine to sew a zipper onto the plastic.“They were able to rivet in plastic onto the PAPR and after we tested it the first time, it worked great,” Bunnell said. “And we knew we had a winner and started going forward with production.”The teams were able to build 16 new face shields right inside the hospital, showing resilience, in uncertain times.“Whether it’s facilities, materials management, our sewers, our respiratory therapists,” Schmiedel said. “This was a great example of our team come together, going through obstacles and being persistent and resilient in finding a solution to benefit our associates. We couldn’t be prouder of them.”I want to share the links with people who are in need of face masks.You can order free face masks on it.https://flexispot.com/free-face-mask"

Alibaba owns a third of Ant, which was also co-founded by Ma.Ram Parameswaran, Octahedron’s founder, expects Ant to resume its IPO and is holding onto Alibaba shares despite China’s unveiling of new anti-monopoly rules.“It’s one of the cheapest commerce businesses in the world if you use a reasonable sum-of-the-parts valuation framework,” Parameswaran said. “There’s lots of monetization runway in the core business with live streaming and recommendation engines.”Despite a slowdown, Alibaba’s revenue is still increasing at least 20% per quarter, while its cloud unit is on track to become profitable for the first time in the year through March. Its Cainiao delivery network is also expanding at its fastest pace on record, boosted by cross-border trade.Coronation CapitalThe Hong Kong-based family office bought more shares of Alibaba after they tumbled on Wednesday and is planning to increase total exposure to about 3% from 0.5% over time.“Alibaba is still going to be a trillion-dollar company in the future,” said founding partner Jin Zi, whose firm manages about $300 million of assets. “Yes, the company is going to come under pressure in the next three-to-five months, but we are investing for the next three-to-five years, and we don’t think other competitors can topple Alibaba.”Kamet CapitalThe family office has been trimming its position in Alibaba, which is one of its largest investments. But it’s still retaining some exposure because Alibaba is highly correlated to a rebounding Chinese economy.The firm’s next moves will depend on how China’s recovery holds up and how policy makers implement the new anti-monopoly rules, said Kerry Goh, the firm’s Singapore-based chief investment officer.“Alibaba will be under pressure,” Goh said. “We want to see how the regulatory pressure balances out the economic recovery.”Commonwealth Avenue Asset ManagementThe macro-oriented investor has confidence that Chinese regulators know what they’re doing and that Ant will likely list within a year from now, albeit at a lower valuation.“Alibaba will still get benefits from the listing,” said Chong Sze King, the firm’s managing director in Singapore. “We think it’s a good time to buy.”Long Corridor Asset ManagementThe Hong Kong-based hedge fund, which oversees about $200 million, boosted its Alibaba position by one-third after the Ant IPO was pulled, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is private.Ali Sheikh, Long Corridor’s chief operating officer, declined to comment.(Updates with Alibaba share price in first and second graph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman had his best trade of all-time earlier this year when he bet against the market, and he's  placing a similar bet again despite the market optimism surrounding the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.What Happened: Business Insider reports that Bill Ackman placed a new hedge against the market Monday.The news came on the same day Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) announced a 90% efficacy rate for their COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The Pershing Square Capital Management CEO announced his new trade at the Financial Times' Dealmaker Conference Tuesday.Ackman is placing an $8-million bet on a surge in corporate defaults.""What's fascinating is the same bet we put on eight months ago is available on the same terms as if there had never been a fire and on the probability that the world is going to be fine,"" he reportedly said.Related Link: Bloomberg Denies Report Of Minority Stake Sale Talks With Bill Ackman's SPACWhy It's Important: Ackman turned a $27-million bet on the same idea into $2.6 billion earlier this spring.Ackman predicted that cases of coronavirus would spike and the market would sell off.The profit made from Ackman's first pandemic trade was put back into portfolio companies like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B), Hilton Worldwide (NYSE: HLT), Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR), Lowe's Corporation (NYSE: LOW) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX).As of Oct. 31, Ackman's hedge fund is up 44% year-to-date. Without the pandemic trade, Ackman's portfolio would be down on the year.The market traded higher Monday on hopes the vaccine will lead to reopening of businesses and sectors.Ackman is ""bearish"" on the vaccine news, as he said it could lead to people taking the virus less seriously.A difficult few months are ahead before the recovery takes off, in the investor's view.

The desire to know where you land in the sea of retirement savers…It’s been said that gridlock is a feature, not a bug, of the US Constitution, and we may be about to find that out. The election results have left some questions to be resolved, but a few things are coming clear: Democrat Joe Biden is the winner of the Presidential race, but down ballot, the Republicans appear to have made important gains. We’re looking at the prospect of divided government – a Biden Administration with a Republican Senate and a Democratic House with a stronger minority. According to JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, this may be the best possible outcome.“A GOP senate majority should ensure that Trump’s pro-business policies stay intact, and if Biden is confirmed we should be able to expect an easing of the trade war, which should boost global trade and corporate earnings growth,” Kolanovic noted.With investor fears allayed – that the Democrats would roll back Trump-era tax policy or focus on aggressive bureaucratic regulation – Kolanovic believes the markets are primed for gains.However, finding the right stock to buy is always a challenge, even in a bullish environment, but TipRanks offers investors the range of metrics necessary to sort through the raw data of the markets and bring those nuggets to light. These include the analyst consensus rating, the upside potential, and the Smart Score; each gives a data point for investors, and taken together, when they all align, they’ll make a powerful signal.The analyst consensus is just that – an average derived from full range of analyst ratings. The upside potential comes from the stock’s collected price targets; it’s a mathematical average that suggests the stock’s possible growth on a one-year time horizon. And the Smart Score uses known predictive factors of market success to give stocks a score that points toward forward performance. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three stocks that check all three of these boxes. Pacific Ethanol (PEIX)We’ll start with a diversified company, with production lines in food products and animal feeds as well as industrial alcohols and renewable fuels. Pacific Ethanol sells its products on the global market, and has seen major gains in 2Q20. Even with recent losses in account, the stock is up a whopping 795% this year.The gains have come since July, as the company expanded production in response to demand for sanitizing alcohols. Sales of alcohol for hand sanitizers has been a major boost for the Pacific Ethanol in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Taking new production and sales potential into account, the company has revised 2020 earnings estimates upward to the $66 million to $86 million range.So far, the company is on track. Like many small-cap manufacturers, Pacific Ethanol was running earnings deficits prior to this year – but COVID-19 changed that. Earnings turned positive in Q2 and remained so in Q3. The sudden shift has investors bullish on the stock.Amit Dayal, 5-star analyst with H.C. Wainwright, sees plenty of reason for an upbeat outlook here. “Investors should note that management indicated that though the company has a firm visibility on pricing, specialty alcohol volumes delivered to customers could vary on a quarterly basis. Given that sanitizers are a key end-market for specialty alcohols, the stock has come under some pressure with positive COVID-19 vaccine related news. However, we believe demand for sanitizer products should remain elevated with increase in any economic activity in the near term. We believe the improved balance sheet and cash flow is allowing the company to make investments in areas of the business that have been previously overlooked, and may have been under-contributing as a result,” Dayal opined.In-line with these comments, Dayal rates this stock a Buy along with a $16 price target. This figure suggests an impressive 174% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Dayal’s track record, click here)All three of the recent reviews on PEIX are positive, making the consensus rating a unanimous Strong Buy. PEIX shares are priced at $5.82 and have been growing fast in 2H20, but the Street expects to see more growth here; the average price target is $16.50, implying 183% growth ahead for Pacific Ethanol. (See PEIX stock analysis on TipRanks)New York Times Company (NYT)Our next stock is a storied name in the publishing world. The New York Times company owns its eponymous newspaper, along with an array of other media assets and Times-related brands. The company boasts a $6.4 billion market cap and upwards of 30 business assets. Its core brands attract 150 million readers every month, and over 6.5 million paid subscriptions.In a news environment as fast-paced and chaotic as 2020 has been, the NYT has reaped the benefit of people’s need to know. The stock is up 20% year-to-date, despite some slips in recent weeks.Covering NYT for J.P. Morgan, analyst Alexia Quadrani writes, “NYT remains our favorite midcap stock, and we see the growth story for digital subs continuing and will very likely reach 10m well ahead of management’s 2025 target. ARPU and margin improvements over time will also make the stock look cheaper on earnings, which will negate the pushback on valuation. While shares could remain a bit more range bound near term until we get more visibility into trends in 2021, we view the sell-off today as creating an attractive entry point.”Quadrani rates this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her $50 price target indicates a potential for 30% in the next 12 months. (To watch Quadrani’s track record, click here)The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on NYT is unanimous, and based on 4 recent reviews. Shares have an average price target of $53, suggesting a 37% one-year upside from the current trading price of $38.53. (See NYT stock analysis on TipRanks)Thor Industries (THO)Last but not least is Thor Industries, a major manufacturer of recreational vehicles. RVs are a popular form of leisure, and have seen a modest gain during the ‘corona time,’ as there are compatible with social distancing requirements while still permitting households to vacation together. Thor owns seven brands, including well-known names like Airstream and Heartland. The company has a $4.8 billion market cap and upwards of $8 billion in annual revenues.Quarterly revenues, which were reported for Q3 earlier this month, have recovered from a short dip earlier this year. The Q3 top line came in at $2.32 billion, the highest of the past four quarters. Earnings, which has been falling since Q3 of last year, showed a massive sequential spike, jumping from 43 cents per share to $2.14. Leisure stocks have been seeing a resurgence recently, and BMO Capital analyst Gerrick Johnson has been reviewing the sector. Of Thor Industries, Johnson writes, “Stocks of leisure companies usually move higher or lower on retail sales results more so than revenues or EPS. We think investor focus will shift after this quarter. Retail has caught up with investor expectations… We think … Thor (THO) will have the longest legs in terms of consumer demand…” Turning to sales numbers, Johnson adds, “Last quarter, management sounded very optimistic about FY2021 and expects the current robust retail and restocking cycle will last through at least the end of its fiscal year.”To this end, Johnson rates THO an Outperform (i.e. Buy) and his $110 price target implies an upside of 26% from current levels. (To watch Johnson’s track record, click here)Once again, we are looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating; Thor has 4 recent Buy reviews. The stock also has a $115 average price target, which suggests a bullish 32% upside for the next 12 months.

Nio StockBased on third-quarter earnings data, Elon Musk's Tesla remains on track and has the capacity to top its goal of 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020.On Oct. 21, the company reported third-quarter revenue of .77 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 39%. Revenue for the Palo Alto-based EV manufacturer came in higher than estimates of $8.26 billion. The sum of all automotive sales revenue for Tesla was $7.6 billion.Meanwhile, with second-quarter revenue of $526.3 million, higher by 139.54% from the same period last year, Shanghai-based EV maker Nio continues to garner investor's attention in the EV space.Be sure to follow Benzinga for Nio's third-quarter earnings, expected Nov. 17 after market close.Levels of sentiment were extraordinarily tight for this study as traders and investors expressed an near-equal weighted confidence for both EV makers.49.2% of respondents said Tesla stock will grow the most by 2025.

If the fund is owned inside a tax-favored account like an IRA or retirement account, the sale will not generate a taxable gain.Plug Power (PLUG) is a strange sort of business. In more than 20 years of operation, the hydrogen fuel cell company has sold a lot of fuel cell systems, but never earned a profit, and never generated positive free cash flow. Instead, Plug funds its operations mainly by issuing and selling new shares -- over and over again. In fact, from 2000 to 2020, Plug's share count has grown from 4.4 million to 399.7 million -- i.e. grown 90x in size.But what a difference a pandemic makes, and what a difference (the hope for) a Green New Deal!As COVID-19 unhinged stock markets from ordinary rules for valuation, and the prospect of a Democratic ""Blue Wave"" showering taxpayer dollars all over the renewable energy industry, Plug Power stock has gone on a tear. Shares of the fuel cell company are up more than 5x from their price at the start of the year, and now trade at nearly 22 times trailing sales, and 34 times book value, despite a total lack of profitability.This doesn't concern H.C Wainwright's Amit Dayal, however. In a note published following Plug's Q3 2020 earnings results, the analyst argues that Plug Power's valuation is really all about the future -- a future as far off as 2024... or even 2030.Plug Power, you see, may not be earning profits right now. But Plug management has repeatedly promised in recent quarters (and repeated the promise on Monday) that in 2024 it will earn $200 million in operating profit and record ""gross billings"" of $1.2 billion.Now, ""gross billings"" aren't a financial metric often recited by publicly traded companies. To translate the term into something more familiar to investors, therefore, Dayal calculates that Plug's revenues in 2024 will be about $1.1 billion -- more than four times the company's trailing revenues currently. Dayal further projects that by 2030, Plug will grow this number even further -- to $7.4 billion in annual sales. And if this number is correct, says Dayal, the company will achieve a 10-year compounded revenue growth rate in excess of 38%.That's a staggering sum, but in fact, it's not entirely unrealistic. In fact, over the past five years alone, Plug has grown its revenues at about a 29% compounded rate. While acceleration to 38% certainly won't be easy, Plug's history of revenue growth suggests it does lie within the realm of possibility.And yet, that's not really the point, is it? The point of a profit-seeking venture like Plug should in theory be not just to ""sell stuff,"" but to earn profits from selling stuff -- and it's here that Plug Power has historically fallen short. In Q3 2020 for example, Plug grew its sales 80% (so twice as fast as Dayal's projected sales growth rate). Problem was, the company also doubled its net loss on those sales, from $18.2 million a year ago, to $39.4 million in Q3.Despite this huge Q3 loss, and despite Plug's unbroken history of similar losses, Dayal insists that Plug's rapid sales growth will eventually bring the company to profitability -- indeed, he projects net profits by 2023, which is even sooner than Plug is promising. With this prospect in mind, he has reiterated his ""buy"" rating on Plug Power stock, and doubled his price target $30. (To watch Dayal's track record, click here)All in all, Plug's strong share appreciation has pushed the stock price above the consensus price target. Shares are selling for $23, and the average target of $20.89 implies a 9% downside. Paradoxically, the stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys and no Holds or Sells.

1,Yale New Haven Health Partners with Capsule Technologies to Provide Remote Surveillance Solutions for COVID-19 Ventilated Patients,https://www.yahoo.com/news/yale-haven-health-partners-capsule-130000360.html,"Ventilated Patient Surveillance Workstation provides caregivers with clinically actionable notifications to support patient and caregiver safetyANDOVER, Mass. and NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), the largest health system in Connecticut, has deployed Capsule's Ventilated Patient Surveillance (VPS) workstation to deliver safe and effective patient care to its COVID-19 ventilated patients, both organizations announced today.With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and the upsurge in patients requiring acute respiratory care, YNHHS reached out to Capsule for a technology solution. Together the organizations devised the Ventilated Patient Surveillance workstation, based on Capsule's existing Remote Surveillance application.           Launched at YNHHS, the Capsule VPS workstation analyzes streaming live data from ventilators, which are not ordinarily connected for surveillance, and escalates emergent clinically actionable events to respiratory therapists, pulmonologists and intensivists. The added surveillance capability complements the health system's established InSight Tele-ICU program, which has employed Capsule's Remote Surveillance solution for many years.""While developing the VPS workstation, we expected it to provide caregivers additional eyes on their patients for delivering timely interventions,"" said Hemant Goel, chief executive officer of Capsule Technologies. ""We realized, soon after deploying these at Yale, that the VPS workstation delivered additional benefits, such as protecting caregivers from unnecessary exposure to infection and reducing the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Yale New Haven is among the first hospitals to deploy the solution, maintaining a high standard of care for today's coronavirus patients, while establishing a higher standard through extended device connectivity.""Due to the risk of infection, YNHHS patient room doors remain closed, and entering and exiting patient areas takes more time than usual for donning and doffing PPE. With a limited number of Respiratory Therapists (RTs) to cover all ventilators, the VPS workstation helps staff determine a clinically advantageous time to go into patient areas and provide care. It also enables RTs outside the room to guide less experienced care team members at the bedside.YNHHS has transformed many non-ICU patient rooms into temporary ICU rooms, creating negative pressure environments to mitigate infection spread. Many of these rooms are isolated and do not have windows into accessways, so ventilators and bedside medical devices are not visible, and alarms are not easily heard. The VPS workstation helps staff remotely see and hear the ventilators in these non-traditional ICU settings. The system's smart rules highlight clinically actionable emergent events, enabling care providers to formulate an effective response. Overall, YNHHS believes that they are achieving superior patient outcomes for COVID-19 ventilated patients compared to most other reported data from hospitals in the U.S.""Our collaboration with Capsule Technologies is an extension of our existing partnership and our own long-held vision for using technology to manage critically ill patients through remote access, analytics and smart notifications,"" said Chris Gutmann, system director, Information Technology and Clinical Engineering at YNHHS.  ""This ventilated patient surveillance solution is not only helping our care teams confront the COVID-19 pandemic today, but I expect it will continue to serve the needs of our clinicians and patients well into the future, becoming a standard of care.""   Ventilated patient surveillance leverages the ventilator connectivity of the Capsule Medical Device Information Platform, used in more than 2,000 U.S. hospitals. Capsule is offering the VPS workstation to its customers in the U.S., where Capsule Surveillance has FDA clearance. To reduce the financial burden on hospitals, the company provides all necessary software licenses for the VPS workstation at no charge to all eligible clients for an initial period of at least six months and potentially longer if the pandemic persists.For more information about ventilated patient surveillance, visit capsuletech.com, or contact Capsule Technologies at 1-800-260-9531 or support@capsuletech.com.About Yale New Haven Health SystemYale New Haven Health (YNHHS), the largest and most comprehensive healthcare system in Connecticut, is recognized for advanced clinical care, quality, service, cost effectiveness and commitment to improving the health status of the communities it serves.

1,Coronavirus: Toronto hospital creates alternative to N95 using snorkel masks,https://globalnews.ca/news/6888415/coronavirus-sunnybrook-health-sciences-centre-n95-snorkel-masks/,"Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre staff say an alternative to the N95 mask has been developed by using a modified full-face snorkel mask for health-care workers to potentially use during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hospital staff told Global News Radio 640 Toronto the alternative mask was developed due to a limited supply of N95 masks in the world and the coronavirus outbreak still going strong.“This is an unprecedented time that is highlighting the need for innovative solutions to the challenges health-care workers are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Brian Courtney, a cardiologist, engineer and scientist at Sunnybrook.

Courtney is partnered with Dr. Brian Li, who is an engineer and interventional cardiologist fellow at Sunnybrook. Their team is also working to potentially create tie-back surgical masks in-house.“In an ideal scenario, we wouldn’t need to use either of these masks. But in case we run out, we are developing alternatives that would allow us to keep doing procedures, look after our patients, and keep our health-care workers safe,” said Courtney.The snorkel masks Courtney and the team are using were donated by Canadian Tire. Courtney said the design also has a way of processing air that would not cause fogging, which was sometimes cited as an issue when it comes to wearing a snorkel mask.He emphasized how important it is to not only have alternatives to the N95 masks, which has a worldwide shortage, but for Canada to also become more involved in the manufacturing of medical supplies in general rather than being depending on importing from other countries.

“I think that there is some importance that is being placed upon during the current pandemic of just recognizing that there’s a need and some opportunity with respect to being more involved in the manufacturing and design of these sorts of technologies going forward,” said Courtney.[ Sign up for our Health IQ newsletter for the latest coronavirus updates ]The team is testing their designs using the same requirements in place for existing N95 and other surgical masks.“Using 3D-printing techniques, the stem snorkel at the top of the mask is replaced by an adapter that fits widely available ventilator cartridges to filter particles in the same manner as N95 masks,” the hospital said in a statement announcing the new mask.Both the masks and the adapter can be reused as long as they are sterilized. The cartridges would be thrown out after each use.

By Frank Nothaft
With a global health crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic comes an enormous amount of rapidly changing, important healthcare data – from the number of confirmed cases by region to hospital ventilator and PPE inventory. Leveraging data-driven insights in real-time is imperative for leaders making critical decisions at the frontlines of this pandemic, but many healthcare organizations are struggling to rapidly and efficiently harness the overwhelming streams of data to meet the demands placed on the healthcare industry.In response to this challenge, data teams worldwide are mobilizing to help solve the most pressing problems of the pandemic. Modern data platforms are providing powerful processing tools that enable researchers, clinicians and administrators at hospitals, government and pharmaceutical organizations to aggregate and analyze diverse datasets to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.Hospital systems
Digital transformation has been a slow burn for most hospital systems, but Covid-19 has ignited an accelerated effort, especially in the move toward analytics of consolidated health records. Hospitals use multiple different Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems that have complex data storage and analytics architectures. These complex architectures mean that these systems can’t easily interact, making it difficult to collect all the data that will provide a complete picture of a patient, which is necessary for building accurate machine learning models. Ultimately, data scientists working with legacy EHR architectures spend more time freeing data from their EHR, and less time building innovative models that can improve patient outcomes.Data scientists are helping push healthcare systems to open interoperable systems that enable seamless analytics across hospitals. Experts advocate for hospital data teams to load EHR data using the open HL7 and FHIR APIs into open source technologies built for analytics like Apache Spark and Delta Lake. As data from EHRs flows more instantaneously, hospitals can build applications to streamline and even automate processes based on real-time information. For example, the data team at a hospital in South Carolina has harnessed the power of AI to build an app that helps caregivers predict a patient’s risk for sepsis and treat them accordingly.This approach can be generalized to a number of use cases: other hospitals use streaming data from EHRs to predict patient surges, ER overcrowding, ventilator inventory and other important operational considerations. By using a unified data platform to blend EHR data with staffing data, a major multi-state hospital system is producing overcrowding statistics by department within less than five minutes of patient intake, which has been crucial in handling patient surges caused by Covid-19.As the novel coronavirus first began to surge in the U.S., one of our partners noticed that most hospitals didn’t know whether a patient surge was likely, or whether they had enough supplies to care for a sudden influx of patients. Data engineers created a specialized AI live streaming app now in use at several hospitals that takes EHR data and builds out predictive dashboards showing how many patients they were likely to receive, ventilator capacity and peak ventilator usage. As healthcare system needs evolve throughout the pandemic, so will the volume of data being generated and how it can be utilized to meet challenges head-on.Government agencies
Data analytics technology is also helping government agencies at the national level rapidly generate up-to-date data sets and run predictive models. This allows them to optimally allocate resources, provide data to public health research efforts and, ultimately, curb the spread of Covid-19. Because much of the data important to government response is being generated in hospitals, the data must be easily communicated between healthcare systems and governments for policy development.On a truly unified platform, government data teams can take internal data sets and prepare them for consumption by approved researchers and the public. Internationally, we’ve been working with a national public health service to build an environment for researchers to access. All relevant health data within this country lands in this environment where government-approved data researchers can work on the data directly without having to worry about setting up the environment themselves or ensuring the system is properly secured. These tools are enabling public health leaders to make data-driven policy decisions as their best and brightest data scientists and researchers work together on pressing public health issues.Pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies
While hospitals meet immediate healthcare needs and governments focus on controlling the spread, many pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies are focusing their energies on developing diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines for Covid-19. These organizations need help analyzing both clinical and real-world observational health data to determine how a drug is being used both in clinical trial settings and compassionate use to treat patients impacted by the virus.A lot of biopharma and diagnostics companies have been using data about the spread of coronavirus to adjust their clinical trials and manufacturing programs rapidly. With this data, they can make sure that medicines and tests are still getting to patients in need, and they can look at how the novel coronavirus is impacting patients in the disease areas that they are focused on.The challenge they face, however, is the right teams having access to the right data in a timely manner. In the life sciences, data scientists may be skilled in statistics and coding but aren’t typically experts in cloud computing. It’s logistically hard to share one’s findings with other teams across an organization, which may mean that data scientists are working on data that is delayed by days or even weeks.Moving forward with data
The pandemic has demonstrated how critical technology modernization is to speed the delivery and analysis of data. Cutting edge computing architectures like cloud data lakes enable healthcare and life science organizations to enable analytics on data in real-time, while notebooks make it easy for data scientists to share information and analysis with their colleagues.Throughout this crisis, the phrase “we’re all in this together” has been repeated often. The data community across industries has embraced this motto and wants to help, and the only thing holding them back is the need for easier access to larger datasets. I have firmly believed that using open-source software to broadly integrate data across multiple biomedical sources is critical to deepening our understanding of disease. Data can allow us to improve our public health response to the pandemic, but only if we enable data scientists with the right tools to harness those datasets.Photo: metamorworks, Getty Images  PromotedA webinar from HealthSparq offers analysis on a consumer sentiment study on health plans.

1,How New Inventions Can Fight Spread Of COVID-19 Indoors,https://www.ibtimes.com/how-new-inventions-can-fight-spread-covid-19-indoors-3012650,"It's become a familiar mantra: masks, hand-washing and physical distancing can slow the spread of the coronavirus while work continues on developing the vaccines and treatments needed to rid the world of its threat.But as tens of millions of people return to public transit, their workplaces and schools, are these interventions enough?Researchers are increasingly looking at the pandemic through the lens of engineering, devising ways to make indoor environments safer. Here's a preview of what's in store.Scientists are getting more worried about the potential airborne spread of the coronavirus, at distances far greater than the two meters (six feet) of spacing urged by guidelines.Certain super-spreading events, such as a choir practice in Washington state in the spring, appeared to involve so-called microdroplets that became suspended in the air.HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters -- technology that first came to market in the 1950s -- are used widely in hospitals, biocontainment labs and airplanes. These use a fan to draw air through felt-like filters to capture the tiniest of microbes.    A far-UVC lamp manufactured in by Ushio Photo: USHIO / Handout  But the filters become contaminated over time and must eventually be incinerated or autoclaved.A research team at the Texas Center for Superconductivity at University of Houston and Galveston National Laboratory has now demonstrated the efficiency of a new type of filter based on an ultra-fine foam made of nickel.By heating the foam to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit), the researchers were able to eliminate 99.8 percent of airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus from a room on first pass.Crucially, the foam is insulated, so it doesn't heat up the room.    A technician applies an anti-microbial coating developed by Allied BioScience's first generation antimicrobial coating Photo: Allied BioScience / -  The team published their findings in the journal Materials Today Physics last week, and Medistar -- the company behind it -- has received regulatory approval to sell the system.The firm says the system can either be installed in pre-existing air conditioning units or walked through a room in a mobile unit.""This is a very timely invention with great potential in fighting against COVID-19, particularly with increasing consensus that COVID-19 can be airborne,"" Gang Chen, an MIT professor who was not involved in the work, told AFP.But since COVID-19 carriers may stay in a room for a prolonged period, the key to how useful any filtration system is lies in how fast it can exchange air at high volume.    A member of the cleaning staff disinfects air vents aboard an Emirates plane; the company Medistar says its new air filtration system based on heated nickel foam can be placed inside air conditioning systems or walked through a plane via a mobile unit Photo: Emirates Airlines / -  Lamps that operate on a particular area of the ultraviolet spectrum known as UVC have long been used to kill bacteria, viruses and molds, notably in hospitals and in the food-processing industry.But direct exposure to UVC is dangerous because the rays, which aren't present in regular sunlight, cause skin cancer and eye problems -- meaning they can only be used once people leave.Researchers at Columbia University have been working for several years on a new type of UVC lamp, whose shorter wavelength of 222 nanometers makes them safe for humans but still lethal to microbes.Last month, a team led by physicist David Brenner published a paper in the journal Scientific Reports showing that their technology killed 99.9 percent of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets.""We really need something in situations like offices, restaurants, airplanes, hospitals,"" Brenner told AFP.Japanese company Ushio has already started selling far-UVC lamps in the US but says on its website that ongoing studies on their safety will decide when they are ready for occupied spaces.Catching the virus via touch is also a potential risk, hence the directives to frequently wash our hands and use disinfectant on surfaces.Long-lasting antimicrobial surface coatings can also complement cleaning products, but the decade-old technology has thus far largely been confined to hospitals.Researchers at the University of Arizona recently proposed widespread use of coatings as a new line of defense against SARS-CoV-2.An antiviral coating made of quaternary ammonium polymer, developed by Allied BioScience, was found to reduce the amount of a coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2 on a surface by 90 percent in 10 minutes.It does this by ""denaturing"" the virus's proteins -- effectively twisting them out of shape -- and attacking its protective layer of fat.The colorless substance is sprayed on surfaces and has to be reapplied every three to four months.""It's not a substitute for regular cleaning and disinfecting, but it covers you in between regular disinfecting and cleaning,"" microbiologist Charles Gerba, who led the study, which has not been peer reviewed, told AFP.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently clarified, however, that surface transmission probably isn't the main way the virus is spread, as some had previously thought."
1,Doctors fighting coronavirus turn to mobile dialysis machines to solve shortage of life-saving kit,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/doctors-fighting-coronavirus-dialysis-machines-a4433406.html,"The latest headlines in your inbox twice a day Monday - Friday plus breaking news updatesRegister with your social account or click here to log inDoctors at the London hospital at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak today told how they rapidly came up with innovative solutions when it ran out of vital life-saving equipment.Medics at Northwick Park in Harrow had the idea of using mobile kidney dialysis machines — normally used by patients at home — in intensive care after being inundated with an “unimaginable” number of critically ill patients.Problems were exacerbated by a national shortage of parts for their hospital machines — the plastic piping that circulates the blood and the fluid that removes the toxins from it.At one stage, doctors had to send a taxi on a 40-mile round trip to St Helier Hospital, near Sutton, to obtain extra supplies. Kidney failure has been one of the biggest problems in the most seriously ill Covid-19 patients.This is believed partly to be a consequence of the need to minimise a patient’s fluid intake to reduce the stress on their lungs. Up to a third of patients admitted to critical care have needed dialysis.When Northwick Park ran out of in-hospital dialysis machines, doctors decided to use the more basic devices used by patients to treat themselves at home — believed to be the first time a UK hospital has done this.They first used several NX Stage machines that are normally used to train patients, and then bought three more.They now have 14 dialysis machines for 48 ICU beds.Tariq Husain, clinical lead for intensive care at Northwick Park, said: “There is always opportunity in crisis and the number of patients requiring intensive care and their illness severity was previously unimaginable... If you can’t dialyze someone who needs dialysis, then they get worse and they die.”Doctors worked with colleagues at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs a large renal unit at Northwick Park, to source the machines.Dr Husain said: “With the shortage of the machines and the fluid and the circuits, we tried to think of another way of offering people dialysis.“What normally happens is that patients get trained how to use them — people on long-term dialysis who start off coming into the hospital three times a week. When it’s felt they’re able to use these machines, they get given one to use at home. We had some spare machines. We started off by using the training ones then we bought three from the manufacturer.”London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Northwick Park, Ealing and Central Middlesex hospitals, has suffered 530 coronavirus deaths – the highest toll in the capital and the second highest in the country.More than 260 Covid patients have been treated in Northwick Park’s intensive care unit since mid-March. Normally it has 800 patients a year.  The trust serves deprived communities in Brent, Ealing and Harrow where there is a high prevalence of diabetes, obesity and heart disease — all risk factors for Covid-19.The “at home” machines do not require replacement pipes or special fluid and operate more quickly than hospital machines, meaning they can be used on several patients a day.Dr Husain said the pressure on the unit had fallen in recent days, in line with a sharp fall in Londoners requiring hospital treatment for the virus — there are now fewer than 2,000 inpatients across the capital with Covid-19.Dr Neill Duncan, a renal consultant at Imperial, said: “One of the positives that has come out of this crisis is just how quickly and effectively everyone has come together to come up with a smart alternative solution.”You can find our Community Guidelines in full

Joint initiative between Department of Health and Social Care, UK Bioindustry Association, British In Vitro Diagnostics Association and Royal College of Pathologists to crowdsource solutions
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medallia, Inc. (NYSE: MDLA), the global leader in experience management, today announced that its Crowdicity cloud platform is being used as part of a major UK-wide initiative to source new and novel solutions to rapidly scale coronavirus testing across the country. The UK Department of Health and Social Care, together with the UK Bioindustry Association, the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association and the Royal College of Pathologists, have deployed Medallia’s crowdsourcing platform to crowdsource ideas from a community of experts in order to meet the UK Government’s target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by the end of April, 2020.

Launched on Friday 10th April, under the campaign alias #testingmethods2020, the initiative is leveraging the Medallia Crowdicity platform to gather innovative ideas, share best practices and agree on viable solutions to four key testing ‘challenges’. Targeted at industry, pharmaceutical organizations, health bodies, academic institutions and existing testing labs, the initiative has already seen over 100 solutions submitted, as well as suggestions and comments from industries, academics organizations and leading UK hospital trusts.

Medallia - which already works with the NHS and the Department of Health and Social Care to drive innovation in patient experience - delivered this new crowdsourcing platform in less than 48 hours.

Professor Dame Sue Hill, Chief Scientific Officer at NHS England and NHS Improvement said, “The coronavirus has created complex challenges for the NHS to face, but our staff have been doing fantastic work in fighting the pandemic already. Through collaborative initiatives like this, we can bring together the brightest and the best to help us introduce innovative solutions to ramp up our testing capacity and achieve the ambitious target that has been set of 100,000 tests a day for the benefit of patients, NHS and social care staff and those working in other sectors.”

“There is no more important use case than this for our Crowdsourcing capabilities,” said Leslie Stretch, CEO of Medallia. “Everyone at Medallia is committed to helping the NHS and every healthcare provider combat COVID-19.”

    Laura Ingle reports.Pediatricians across the country have said they're worried about the potential for new outbreaks of diseases that had been eradicated years ago, because children are getting fewer vaccines overall, according to recent data.The number of non-flu vaccines ordered for children is at least 2.5 million doses lower than the same time last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Doctors in all 50 states have seen a steep drop in the number of kids coming in for routine visits, and it has resulted in children forgoing their routine vaccinations and boosters. ""The first fall was when the first case of COVID was identified in Washington,"" Dr. Jose Romero, the chief medical officer of the Arkansas Department of Health, said. ""There's been a significant fall following the declaration of a national emergency.""ARIZONA VINTAGE SHOP PRAISED FOR 'SPOT-ON' SIGN MANDATING MASKS: 'LOVE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR'Many parents said they didn't feel safe bringing their healthy kids to the doctor and risk them contracting COVID-19. ""People voted with their feet and didn't come,"" Dr. Eileen Costello, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, said. ""We were seeing only about 10 percent of our usual volume of kids."" ""We serve a population that has been disproportionately impacted by this illness,"" Costello added. ""I think that made us especially worried that people were not going to want to come to the hospital with their kids to protect them against an illness that could have more devastating outcomes than COVID-19 for a child.""To combat the decline in vaccinations, local pediatricians around the country have been coming up with creative ways to get kids protected.SURGEON GENERAL JEROME ADAMS: STRICT LOCKDOWN WON'T MATTER IF WE DON'T FOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCINGBoston Medical Center is one of those hospitals, rolling out what it called ""Plan B."" The hospital partnered with Brewster Ambulance Service and borrowed one of its vehicles. Nurses started calling patients and mapping out routes for the doctors to administer vaccines on children's driveways. So far, the program has helped get more than 450 kids vaccinated. Other states have opted to try drive-up or curbside doctor visits; some states were encouraging parents to get vaccinations from pharmacists at their local drugstores. Arkansas Children's Hospital opened a drive-thru vaccine station in April to make sure its established primary care patients had an easy opportunity. Hospital officials reported that parents have had great things to say about it. Other physicians were choosing to see sick patients in the morning and healthy children in the afternoon. Romero is also the chief of pediatric infectious disease at Arkansas Children's Hospital. He said the biggest concern for health officials has been a potential outbreak of non-COVID-related viruses.""If you don't have enough people, enough children immunized in a community, you can start up with an outbreak like we see in other states in the past,"" Romero said. ""If we start to lose that buffer zone that we have with lots of children immunized, we're going to start to see diseases that in my career have been eradicated.""CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPRomero said his most important message to parents was that it's safe to go get vaccinated.

1,Hospital for children sports center turned to alternative care site due to COVID-19,https://www.csemag.com/articles/hospital-for-children-sports-center-turned-to-alternative-care-site-due-to-covid-19/,"Normally filled with physical therapy and rehabilitation equipment, the gym at Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children is now a care site for non-coronavirus patients if a nearby hospital is experience a surge of COVID-19 patients.The Nemours expansion was designed by members of our FKP/CannonDesign Health Practice and opened in 2014. The Nemours gym is one of two alternate care sites in New Castle County in Delaware. It is reserved only if hospitals are overwhelmed, and will care for low acuity patients, such as those needing long-term medications.“I never imagined having to set this (up),” Dr. Christopher Raab, the site’s medical director and a pediatrician at Nemours, told the Delaware News Journal. “Normally, this room is chock full of big, heavy equipment, and that was gone in a day. To see the physical transformation of this room is amazing.”This is the second time this space has been transformed. The old space used to be a basketball court and our team worked to redesign the space and convert it into a multi-use space. Basketball is still being played in the space but now they also have three therapy rooms and an open gym for physical therapy and rehabilitation.All patients entering the site would need a negative coronavirus test. No visitors are allowed, as with most healthcare facilities across the country, and even the number of doctors allowed onsite is limited.“When push comes to shove, the medical community always rises up,” Raab said. “You do whatever you have to do to help the people in front of you, and that’s a fantastic feeling.”This article originally appeared on CannonDesign’s website. CannonDesign is a CFE Media content partner."
1,African solutions to the coronavirus crisis,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52776994,"By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC NewsThe African continent hasn't been as badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic as other countries in the world so far, but new cases are on the rise and governments have introduced social distancing measures.And while the pandemic is bad for business, some African entrepreneurs have stepped up to be part of the solution and are seeing new opportunities. Frequent and thorough washing of hands with soap and warm water is one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. But according to Water Aid, four in 10 people around the world have no access to basic hand washing facilities. One of the ways in which the coronavirus is spread is via contaminated surfaces. Getting into the habit of regular hand washing can prevent infections, but the virus can still spread as people tend to touch the tap and other things around them.In a city like Freetown in Sierra Leone, a population of 2 million people has a water supply capacity which ideally should be used by no more than 800,000 people, according to international development consultancy firm IMC Worldwide. Water is already scarce, and now hand washing is crucial.To solve this problem, one business has developed a portable hands-free tap unit that is now being placed outside shops, banks and government buildings.The Fomel Industry and National Industrialization Centre (FINIC) usually specialises in manufacturing agriculture processing equipment and other machines.But now the firm, founded by Melvin Foday Kamara, is manufacturing a portable freestanding hands-free faucet that is operated by stepping on pedals to access soap and water on demand.Clean running water is also in short supply in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, where citizens told the BBC they are now washing their hands with washing up liquid, as they cannot afford to buy hand sanitiser.""In the area where I live, running water is very scarce, so we actually have to have buckets of water so that it's easy for us to wash our hands,"" Wadzanayi Musasa explains.""When we get home from the shops, we take off our gloves, we use dish washing liquid to wash our hands and someone will hold a jug of water [to rinse them].""Waste management and clean water provider Clean City is now distributing water around Harare's residential and commercial areas in tank trucks, so that citizens can collect extra buckets of water to ensure hygiene standards are preserved through the lockdown.The company started in 2018, in response to two cholera epidemics that hit Zimbabwe in 2008 and 2018. The firm says it realised that something had to be done to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Compared to people living in richer nations, people in developing countries are more negatively impacted by waste that isn't managed properly, which puts both human health and the environment at risk.More than 90% of waste in developing nations goes to dumpsites, according to data from the United Nations Environment Programme.Every day, Clean City also offers fumigation and decontamination services across Harare, which can be ordered using a mobile app.""We're basically driven by two principles - digital first and people first,"" says Clean City's chief executive Lovemore Nyatsine.""Everything is contactless. Our crews follow very clear processes to keep our clients and themselves safe.""One example of an industry stepping up as a result of the pandemic is the 3D printing community - tech firms, universities and 3D print enthusiasts with their own printers are responding to the shortage of healthcare workers' personal protective equipment (PPE) - and in some cases more complex hospital medical supplies - by making it themselves. Malawi has been experiencing severe shortages of PPE during the coronavirus lockdown.The shortages are due to costs of procuring the equipment, as well as disruption caused by the pandemic to global supply chains. Blantyre-based tech firm iMoSyS is one such company that is now using its 3D printers and computer assisted design (CAD) software to design reusable face masks and face shields for healthcare workers.Typically the firm focuses on providing IT and engineering services to enable the remote monitoring of industrial processes, infrastructure and patients' health.Entrepreneur Mayamiko Nkoloma, chief executive of iMoSyS, says his firm has received numerous requests from across the African continent, but also from overseas countries including the UK.""Anything is possible. We started with nothing but ideas, and we took our ideas to industries and pitched them to solve challenges,"" he tells the BBC.Despite the myriad challenges presented by the pandemic, to say nothing of the looming recession once lockdown measures are eventually lifted, some firms feel trying times are when real growth and change is possible.""As bad as the coronavirus is, it has provided the opportunity for many leaders in business and in governance to have a rethink,"" says Mr Karama of Finic in Sierra Leone. ""It is important that we leverage innovation...it is important that Africa learns to innovate, to monetise [and] not to import everything.""

0,New York hospital built for coronavirus cost $52 million but only treated 79 patients,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-new-york-billie-jean-king-queens-hospital-centre-a9630206.html,"Staff and officials blame bureaucracy and communication failures for site’s inadequate use, reports Brian M RosenthalFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profilehe Queens Hospital Centre emergency department has a capacity of 60, but on its worst night of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 180 patients lay on stretchers in the observation bays and hallways. Alarms rang incessantly as exhausted doctors rushed from crisis to crisis.Less than 4 miles away, a temporary hospital opened the next morning, on 10 April. The facility, which was built at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre to relieve the city’s overwhelmed hospitals, had hundreds of beds and scores of medical professionals trained to treat virus patients.But in the entire month that the site remained open, it treated just three patients from the Queens Hospital Centre emergency department, records show. Overall, the field hospital cost more than $52m (£40.9m) and served only 79 patients.The pandemic has presented unique challenges for officials grappling with a fast-moving and largely unpredictable foe. But the story of the Billie Jean King facility illustrates the missteps made at every level of government in the race to create more hospital capacity in New York. It is a cautionary tale for other states now facing surges in cases and for New Yorkers bracing for a possible second wave.Doctors at the Queens Hospital Centre, a public hospital in Jamaica, and at other medical centres wanted to transfer patients to Billie Jean King. But they were blocked by bureaucracy, turf battles and communication failures, according to internal documents and interviews with workers.New York paid as much as $732 (£576) an hour for some doctors at Billie Jean King, but the city made them spend hours on paperwork. They were supposed to treat coronavirus patients but they did not accept people with fevers, a hallmark symptom of the virus. Officials said the site would serve critically ill patients, but workers said it opened with only one or two ventilators.“I basically got paid $2,000 (£1,574) a day to sit on my phone and look at Facebook,” said Katie Capano, a nurse practitioner from Baltimore who worked at Billie Jean King. “We all felt guilty. I felt really ashamed, to be honest.”As the coronavirus spread in March, the federal government, state leaders, city officials and hospital executives all began creating their own temporary medical facilities, at times competing against each other. Governor Andrew Cuomo’s office oversaw most transfers to the centres, but city officials say the state did not closely coordinate with other players.The federal government’s biggest contribution, Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort, arrived in New York with great fanfare but initially did not accept coronavirus patients at all, prompting one hospital executive to call it “a joke”.Even once the Comfort began treating people with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, the hospital ship and another overflow facility run by the state, located at the James K Javits Convention Centre, mostly accepted patients transferred from private medical centres, not from the public hospitals that were the most besieged, according to government data.Billie Jean King, the only emergency hospital built by the city, should have been a success story: it opened at the height of the pandemic, with a full staff eager to treat virus patients.An aide to the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who helped oversee the site, Jackie Bray, said the city acted quickly to open it but ultimately concluded patients were best treated at existing hospitals, even if they were crowded. She added that she expected the federal government to reimburse the city for the cost of the facility.Officials with the city and the state said Billie Jean King and other temporary sites treated so few patients because New York’s statewide shutdown curtailed the virus and hospitals expanded their own capacity, reducing the need for extra beds.“The alternative space was less used than we expected it to be because we broke the curve, thank goodness,” Ms Bray said.Doctors disagreed.“The conditions in the emergency room during this crisis were unacceptable and dangerous,” said Dr Timothy Tan, director of clinical operations at the Queens Hospital Centre emergency department. “Knowing what our patients had to endure in an overcrowded emergency department, it’s frustrating how few patients were treated at facilities such as Billie Jean King.”In past disasters, such as during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the state created a unified system across multiple agencies to transfer patients between hospitals. That did not happen during the coronavirus pandemic, leaving hospitals in low-income areas overwhelmed.Instead, with projections forecasting a severe shortage of beds, officials focused on building field hospitals.The largest facilities opened in Manhattan in late March – the Comfort and the Javits Centre. They treated about 1,400 patients although only about 300 came from public hospitals, data shows.Hospitals also opened overflow locations, including a Central Park tent hospital that treated 300 patients from Mount Sinai Hospital. The city’s public hospital system created a wing at a nursing home on Roosevelt Island.Facing a projected shortage of 50,000 beds, federal officials spent more than $320m (£251.8m) to build facilities at two state colleges and the Westchester County Centre, and the city spent about $20m (£15.7m) on a centre at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, records show. In the end, reality never neared the dire projections and none of those facilities opened.The only makeshift hospital the city opened was at Billie Jean King.The complex, home of the US Open, is at the site of the 1964 World’s Fair in Flushing Meadow and is one of the largest tennis centres in the world.Officials put out a call on 18 March, saying they needed a contractor that could open a hospital in seven days and run it. Only one vendor said it could do it: Slsco, a company from Galveston, Texas, best known for helping build part of Donald Trump’s border wall.Slsco had spent $90,000 (£70,805) annually to lobby New York in recent years and received contracts after Hurricane Sandy, records show. The company referred questions to city officials.The contract paid Slsco whatever costs it incurred for creating and operating 470 beds for “Covid-positive patients of medium and high acuity” – plus an additional 18 per cent for profit and overhead, the deal said. The final bill is still being tallied: it could top $100m (£78.6m).“This is a war effort,” Mr de Blasio said in a news conference at the tennis centre in late March, announcing it would open on 7 April. “This facility will be crucial.”The site opened on 10 April during the grimmest week of the pandemic, with records in statewide hospitalisations and deaths.The night before, the patients in the Queens Hospital Centre emergency department included 66 who were so sick that they had already been admitted and were waiting for beds, according to a hospital log.City officials said emergency department patients were inappropriate for Billie Jean King. The site did not have all of the equipment, drugs and services available at a permanent hospital, they said.Dani Lever, communications director for Mr Cuomo, said the Queens Hospital Centre transferred 11 patients to the Javits Center that night and could have sent more. The state accommodated every transfer request from hospitals, Ms Lever said.Other nearby hospitals were also in crisis, including Elmhurst Hospital Centre and several small private hospitals.Slsco had recruited hundreds of workers from across the country. It paid most doctors about $600 (£472) an hour, or $900 (£708) for overtime, according to the contract – far more than the typical rates at hospitals. Registered nurses made more than $250 (£196) an hour, as did pharmacists and physician assistants.But in the early days they spent hours in orientation to learn computer systems, waiting to get fitted for masks and looking for equipment, workers said. They also said they had to complete repetitive paperwork.“Extreme dysfunction,” Dr Kim Sue said about working there. “Bureaucracy and dysfunction, and all kinds of barriers to serving patients.”But the biggest barrier was simple: hospitals did not send many patients to Billie Jean King.The city did not allow ambulances to take 911 calls to Billie Jean King because health officials said they did not trust the facility to triage patients. The site had its own ambulances, but they could not pick up transfers because, according to some workers at the site, hospitals had exclusive agreements with ambulance companies. So doctors had to wait for transfers. Few came.In interviews, doctors at overwhelmed private hospitals said they were told they could not transfer to Billie Jean King because it was only for patients from public hospitals.Several doctors at public hospitals said they believed their bosses did not want to transfer because the hospitals in the public system each had their own budgets, and they did not receive revenue from patients they sent away. Some said they were told Billie Jean King could treat only people with extremely mild symptoms.There were at least 25 medical conditions that disqualified patients from being transferred to Billie Jean King, including “spiking” fevers, a city spokesman acknowledged.At Billie Jean King, seven workers said in interviews that even with limited ventilators, they could treat most severely ill patients. They said they grew increasingly frustrated to report every day to a sea of empty beds. Several mentioned that three men with mild symptoms died while quarantining at a Manhattan hotel.“We were sitting on all of these beds with hundreds of people trained to watch over patients exactly like that, and these people died,” said Elizabeth Ianelli, a social worker at the site. “That was preventable.”City officials said the men were not sick enough for Billie Jean King’s level of care. They said all hospitals could transfer to the site, which had enough ventilators, and said the ambulances did not pick up because they needed to be available in case patients at Billie Jean King deteriorated and needed to be transferred. Nobody was thinking about patient revenue, they said.“The thing that saved the most lives was to treat them in expanded capacity in the hospitals and bring staff into the hospitals, and that’s what we were focused on,” said Matt Siegler, a senior vice president at the city’s public hospital system which oversaw the site.Mr Siegler said he could not think of anything the city should have done differently.On 27 April, the city amended the contract to pay Slsco for only a 100-bed facility for patients with “low to moderate” needs.It closed on 13 May.New York TimesStaff and officials blame bureaucracy and communication failures for site’s inadequate use, reports Brian M RosenthalNYPD officers wearing face masks stand outside the temporary Billie Jean King hospitalGettySoldiers are seen at the hospital when it first opened though many now say it was not properly utilised by officialsAFP via Gettyde Blasio, who one called the temporary site a ‘war effort’, gives a press conference at the hospitalAFP via GettyAlready have an account?

Covering the impact of coronavirus on the sports world
The NBA is a 30-team league. It has been a 30-team league for almost two decades, and if Adam Silver is to be believed, it planned to remain a 30-team league for the foreseeable future. Note the past tense of the word ""planned,"" there, because nothing wrecks plans quite like pandemics. The NBA is absolutely bleeding right now. March estimates suggested a potential billion-dollar loss for the league based only on the coronavirus' impact on this season. If the pandemic stretches on without a vaccine, billions more could be lost in future gate and television revenue. As Silver himself has said, the NBA's financial infrastructure is not built to withstand a prolonged pandemic. Making it through this is going to require cash that the NBA may not have, or may not have the ability to generate through traditional means. Which brings us back to the league's commitment to a 30-team model. If the NBA is willing to be flexible on the number of teams it puts on the floor, expansion could solve many of its short-term financial issues. With that in mind, let's dive into everything you need to know about expansion both on and off of the court, starting with the enormous economic ramifications of adding new teams. The simplest way to view expansion, from an economic perspective, is to think of it as the sale of a team that does not exist yet. A buyer or a group of buyers purchases a team not from an existing owner, but from the league itself. As the league is nothing more than the 30 teams that make it up, the sale price is split evenly among those 30 teams, and because it is not considered basketball-related income, the teams keep every cent of that money for themselves. Players see none of it, and they have no say in whether or not the league can expand. The price of an expansion team is not set in stone. Typically, it is a slight inflation of the perceived value of a team in a similar market. The Charlotte Bobcats paid a $300 million expansion fee in 2004. Based purely on potential profit, this was a slight overpay. The Dallas Mavericks were sold for less than that at $285 million only four years earlier despite existing in a stronger market, and the Boston Celtics, one of the league's crown jewels, fetched only $360 million in 2002. Setting a market price in 2020 comes with some complications, though. Obviously the coronavirus pandemic's impact on the global economy has been pronounced, but the complications surrounding expansion pricing extend further than that. The last three teams that have changed hands were sold at market-shattering prices. The Los Angeles Clippers and Houston Rockets both sold for at least $2 billion, but perhaps more telling was the $850 million price that the Atlanta Hawks garnered in a relatively modest NBA market. Four years earlier, the Philadephia 76ers fetched only one-third of that price at $280 million with a nearly identical metro population and more concentrated wealth. Five years ago, the NBA was in the middle of a valuation boom, but television ratings have since declined and the pandemic has put the league in a vulnerable position. They certainly wouldn't settle for those early-decade prices, but buyers wouldn't be willing to pay the premium that Steve Ballmer (Clippers) and Tillman Fertitta (Rockets) did, either. Even given the current economic state of the world, interest is so great that the league would likely draw hefty fees. While the $2 billion figure an anonymous owner gave The Athletic's David Aldridge in 2017 is likely far-fetched, it is not a stretch to suggest $1.5 billion as a starting point. At that price, each team would get a $50 million payout to do with what they saw fit. Remember that slight inflation of market value I mentioned earlier? It comes because the mere presence of a new team lowers the value of any existing ones. Why? Television. Adding a new market adds very little value to the league as a nationally televised product because the primary drivers of ratings, such as the existing big-market teams and the postseason, remain unchanged. But because national television revenue is shared evenly among all teams, those new teams cut into the income every other team would generate even if they aren't creating more of it. There are other revenue streams that are affected similarly, but television is the most important. Think of the new owners as angel investors buying stock in the league as a whole. It infuses cash into the business immediately, but dilutes the long-term earnings for any previous investors.And then there's the invisible cost of leverage. Leagues prefer to keep a deep stable of possible relocation markets in their back pocket to hold over their existing cities. If one of those cities doesn't want to play ball on a new arena, the NBA can merely point to what happened to Seattle as proof that it isn't bluffing when it threatens to move a team. Filling in the best available markets takes them off the board as leverage. Sending a team back to a preexisting market greatly weakens the league's negotiating power as a whole. What's the harm in losing a team if you can just get a new one in a decade or two?Cover your ears, children; it's time for the dreaded ""D"" word. Adding new teams does not expand the existing player pool, so more teams wind up sharing the same amount of talent. That means inevitable talent dilution. Accumulating top players becomes harder for teams when newer competitors for those players arise, but that distribution tends not to be even. Expansion teams tend to serve as roadkill for their contending counterparts. The 1995-96 Chicago Bulls won 72 games, but did so at a point in which six new teams had been added to the league within the previous seven seasons. Servicing all of those new markets wound up fattening the league up for slaughter at the hands of Michael Jordan. There's also the prospect of realignment. The NBA currently has 30 teams. For the sake of balance, it cannot add a single team. It would be unfair to one conference if the other had fewer competitors, therefore, any expansion plan likely has to account for two new teams. Where those teams fall geographically means quite a bit. As we'll discuss, most of the best expansion markets would make more sense in the Western Conference. To compensate, that could allow for a current Western Conference team to switch over to the East. Minnesota and Memphis both make geographical sense, and moving one of them would cut down on travel time for both themselves and the rest of the league. And then there's the matter of the schedule. The current system pits each team against their divisional opponents four times, their non-conference opponents twice, and then splits up the remainder of their conference opponents so that they play six of them four times and the remaining four three times. That math falls apart with two more teams. There are a few ways the league could go about changing that. If, for instance, the idea of cutting games out of the regular season gains any traction, teams could theoretically play each of their non-conference opponents twice and each of their conference opponents three times. That would put a total of 77 games on the schedule. If the league remains squeamish, especially after diluting its revenue, it could add extra games against divisional opponents, or even some form of flexible scheduling to accommodate either a play-in or mid-season tournament. When new teams are born, the NBA fills them with something called an expansion draft. In this exercise, every team in the NBA is allowed to protect a certain number of its players (in 2004, it was eight). If a team has less than eight players under contract, then it must make at least one player available. Any player left unprotected could then be drafted by the expansion team, but no existing NBA team can lose more than one player. Such rules would be subject to change, but that was the system used for the Bobcats in the league's last expansion draft. Typically, the players made available aren't particularly desirable, but occasional gems slip through the cracks. Gerald Wallace, B.J. Armstrong, Rick Mahorn and Walt Bellamy stand out as some of the biggest names ever selected.Expansion teams also have picks in the actual NBA Draft. There is no hard-and-fast rule for determining where they select in their inaugural seasons. The then-Vancouver Grizzlies and Toronto Raptors selected No. 6 and No. 7, respectively, in 1995. The Bobcats had the No. 4 pick, but traded up to No. 2. These picks were not awarded in the lottery, but were given out by the commissioner. Finally, we need to address the cap. Considering their lack of prior financial burdens, the NBA limits how much new teams can spend in order to protect the rest of the league from being easily outbid for free agents. In an expansion team's first season, it can use only 66.7 percent of the cap, and in its second, it can use up to 80 percent of the cap. In its third season, an expansion team has the entire salary cap at its disposal. Players don't technically have a say in the decision to expand, but they hold an unusual amount of leverage at this particular moment. While no expansion decision is remotely imminent, doing so while the league is still sorting through the fallout of COVID-19 would likely require some degree of cooperation from the players due to the inevitable negotiations that will take place over a number of other coronavirus-related concerns. If the NBA wanted to scrap the CBA-designated method of setting the salary cap in the interest of a short-term alternative, for instance, it would need the players to sign off. There's also the threat of a strike if players and owners ever disagree on the safety of playing during the pandemic. The two sides will have to work closely together on a number of issues over the next several years. A fully unilateral decision to expand likely wouldn't be well-received. Fortunately, even if the league did decide to expand without communicating with the union, there are several benefits for players who wouldn't have to be collectively bargained. The biggest is the influx of new jobs. Two new teams mean 30 new roster spots and four more two-way slots to be filled. For rank-and-file union members, that could be the difference between remaining in the NBA and heading to Europe, and it would certainly help a number of fringe players reach the necessary three years of service for their pensions to vest. For higher-level players, more teams equals more competition for their services, which theoretically drives up price.There's also valuable optionality in having more markets in the league. Not only does that mean players have more cities to choose from in free agency, but it creates meaningful stylistic diversity. This is especially important in light of the homogenization of playing styles currently taking place around the league. As teams continue to emphasize shooting, extra franchises mean extra chances for deviation. That deviation creates opportunities for different sorts of players to get paid. The downsides, though, are potentially significant. While the short-term salary cap is in flux, it will eventually revert to its typical state: a predetermined percentage of projected revenue split equally among every team. New teams do generate new revenue locally, but as we've discussed, have little value on the national stage, so while the league's total revenue would rise with expansion, it would not grow nearly enough to offset the damage of dividing that revenue among 32 teams rather than 30. Put more simply, adding teams lowers the cap. That impacts players at every level. The maximum salary is defined as a percentage of the cap in a given year. The Mid-Level Exception is based on the average salary in a given year. While the minimum salary is predetermined, a lowered cap limits financial upward mobility through common sense. Teams will always prioritize spending their space on better players, so cutting into cap space would likely force lower-level players to accept minimum deals more readily because there just wouldn't be space available.While the union would not have the power to demand concessions upon the immediate formation of expansion teams, it could negotiate its way around some of these hurdles. A possible solution to a lower max, for instance, would be to loosen the eligibility restrictions on both ""Rose Rule"" (prohibits teams from having two designated players on their roster at the same time), and supermax contracts. Both allow players to earn above their designated max by reaching certain criteria. The criteria for each include All-NBA selections, so perhaps the addition of a fourth All-NBA team would offset some of the damage. If the average salary declines, the NBA could offset some of the lost Mid-Level salary by raising the ceiling on other forms of the exception, such as the Tax-Payer- and Cap Room-Mid-Level Exceptions. These are merely suggestions. The overarching point is that the union could solve many of the problems new teams would present while also reaping the benefits those extra jobs created. Broadly speaking, a city needs to hit a few important checkmarks in order to interest the NBA. It needs to either have an NBA-ready arena or the willingness to build one. It needs to hit not only a certain population threshold, but contain enough of a corporate presence to fill luxury boxes and other premium seats. It needs to be a certain distance away from other NBA markets so as not to impede on their territory. And it needs to have some interest in either basketball or at least more professional sports. That describes at least a dozen cities that don't currently have teams, but four stand out. With apologies to Pittsburgh, Anaheim, Louisville and Virginia Beach, these are the four cities that check the most boxes for the NBA: Seattle: The city that the NBA left over a decade ago is the one it could potentially return to now for two main reasons. The first is the redevelopment of KeyArena. Seattle was not willing to invest in a stadium in 2007. It is already doing so now even without the guarantee of a franchise. When finished, the new KeyArena will be able to support both an NBA and an NHL team. Seattle's other major advantage? Its status as a tech hub, led by Amazon. A new team would have no trouble filling its luxury boxes, and while Chris Hansen would be viewed as the heavy front-runner to lead an ownership group, Seattle has so many billionaires in and around the city that the NBA could potentially drum up something of a bidding war for the right to revive the Sonics. Seattle fans have made it perfectly clear that they want a team back. The city has supported NBA basketball before. It is the second-biggest American market without a team right now (behind only Tampa Bay). On paper, this is a slam dunk. The only concern the NBA might have is setting the precedent that it is willing to send teams back to abandoned markets. If Seattle gets a team back, what would stop any other city from assuming it could lose a team and get it back down the line as well? This would appear to be more of a concern under David Stern than it is under Adam Silver, but it's the only major hiccup in a potential Seattle bid. Las Vegas: So far, professional sports have flourished in Vegas. The Golden Knights have thrived in T-Mobile Arena (which an NBA team would presumably share), and the Raiders are about to move into a state-of-the-art new stadium. The league already has a foothold in the desert, thanks to summer league and the G League Showcase. Vegas is a relatively small market, beating only New Orleans, Memphis and Oklahoma City in size, but it draws such massive tourism traffic under normal circumstances that filling an arena likely wouldn't be a problem. But the tourism industry is a double-edged sword. Vegas is getting slammed by the coronavirus because it is almost entirely dependent on tourism revenue. Even if a vaccine is found, it will take the global economy years afterward to recover to the point at which people will have enough disposable income to travel at prior levels. Vegas made perfect sense a year ago. Now? The city is facing so much economic uncertainty that its NBA dreams may no longer be viable. Kansas City: Another fairly small market, but a potentially valuable one. There isn't another NBA team within 350 miles of Kansas City. A territory that has been casually divided among the Bulls, Pacers, Grizzlies and Thunder could belong to a Kansas City expansion team. The city has a top-notch arena in the Sprint Center just waiting to be filled. Corporate presence will be Kansas City's greatest challenge. Missouri has a few big ones in its backyard such as Sprint and Anheuser-Busch, but it trails significantly behind Seattle and the Vegas casinos in that way. There is also the question of interest. Yes, the state of Kansas supports its Jayhawks, but the Kings spent over a decade in Kansas City without making much of a dent. Mexico City: The ultimate wild-card in any expansion talks. Mexico City is the NBA's dream market. It has a bigger population than New York, and a more densely populated one at that. It has a fairly new arena that has hosted NBA games before (albeit with some incidents, including a fire in 2013). International expansion has real momentum right now in light of Toronto's ascension to the top of the league. If a team can succeed in Canada, then theoretically, it could succeed in Mexico. But for every benefit, there is a major concern. Mexico City is not particularly wealthy. It is not especially safe either. The NBA had trouble convincing players to move to Vancouver. Mexico City would be an even tougher sell. The altitude would create a potentially unfair home-court advantage and perhaps even some medical concerns. Mexico City has the highest upside of any potential expansion market. It also comes with more risk than literally any city that any North American professional sports league has ever expanded into.Inertia is the most powerful force in sports. Convincing 30 billionaires to try anything new is difficult because, well, they are already billionaires. What they're doing seems to be working. That was largely true in the NBA before this pandemic. While there have been some notable hiccups, revenue continues to rise annually. As recently as a year ago, Silver shot down imminent expansion.But necessity is the mother of invention, and it cannot be argued how badly the NBA needs cash right now. The league already nearly doubled its line of credit. It cut player salaries by 25 percent for the time being, but that measure is temporary, and even with escrow withholdings and the force majeure clause, it is unlikely that teams will be able to shave enough expenses to offset the massive losses they are currently sustaining. With no vaccine in sight, there is no telling when fans will be able to return to arenas. They account for an estimated 40 percent of league revenue.Some owners can weather this storm. Steve Ballmer has $50 billion. He is going to be fine. Not every owner is so fortunate. Houston's Tilman Fertitta needed to take out a $300 million loan at a 13 percent interest rate just to keep his restaurant empire afloat, and his purchase of the Rockets in the first place already left him heavily leveraged. Some families that bought their franchises decades ago, including the Buss (Lakers) and Reinsdorf (Bulls and White Sox) ownership groups, lack other significant streams of income outside of professional sports. The same could theoretically be said of Michael Jordan, as premium sneaker sales are likely to decline sharply as well. It's easy to think of owners as a monolith, but the truth of the matter is that their wealth varies wildly and some are significantly better prepared to handle a prolonged loss of revenue than others. At the moment, it would be naive to assume that expansion is imminent, but it would also be naive to assume that owners aren't considering the prospect. The odds are substantially lower than 50 percent, but the unique circumstances the league now faces ensures that they are higher than zero.Were the NBA to seriously entertain expansion, the earliest possible timeline would have new teams playing by the 2022-23 season. The Bobcats were announced roughly 18 months before beginning play, but that time frame does not include what were doubtlessly months of negotiations prior. If the NBA is desperate enough, those negotiations could be expedited, but there is no guarantee. Even if the league decided tomorrow that it wanted to expand, it would likely need at least a few months to find buyers, and then more than a year to integrate those new teams into the league. Even now, it makes sense to characterize this scenario as ""unlikely."" There are significant long-term costs associated with expansion that most teams would strongly prefer to avoid. But desperate times call for desperate measures. The NBA may never have faced more desperate times than it is now, and if it is seeking a desperate measure to compensate, expansion is by far the best one available. We bring sports news that matters to your inbox, to help you stay informed and get a winning edge.© 2004-2020 CBS Interactive.

0,MLS should look to Liga MX to solve their Covid-19 schedule problem,https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/soccer/mls-should-look-to-liga-mx-to-solve-their-covid-19-schedule-problem/ar-BB12bVHw,"What had been whispered around MLS circles the last week or two has now been spoken out loud: the league reportedly aims to resume play from its coronavirus-enforced hiatus in early July.Despite there being only 25 weeks between the first full week of July and New Years 2021, however, MLS insists they plan to play out the remaining 32 games of the 34-game schedule. This is foolish.Cramming that many games, and that much travel, into such a limited time frame would hurt the on-field product and, more importantly, grind the players into Soylent. That’s assuming venues that are shared with other tenants like Yankee Stadium, Soldier Field, and CenturyLink Field are even available. It’s not a tenable solution. It’s also worth noting that “early July” is starting to feel like an optimistic target, with some models showing the peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations not coming until... early July, so the timeframe may be even more compressed.Some folks have started kicking around the idea of nixing the playoffs, which doesn’t feel right to me. Like it or not, MLS Cup is the league’s biggest event, and on this continent we like our champions to prove their mettle over the course of both the regular season and the playoffs.There have been musings about realigning the calendar to fit with the big European leagues that begin their seasons in the fall and end in early summer, and starting a 2020-21 season this summer. Unless it’s something MLS had already planned to do, though, that seems like a massive overreaction, at least until climate change makes Toronto and Colorado and several other places playable in December and February.No, MLS should play a truncated regular season and keep last year’s sprint of a playoff format. And, luckily for us, a template exists for how to come at this.For as long as anyone can remember, the Apertura/Clausura system has been widespread in Latin America. Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and most of Central America, plus others, play two tournaments each calendar year. There is nothing preventing MLS from adapting that approach to the six months they’d have left in 2020.Liga MX, for example, plays a single-table single-round-robin format each summer and again each winter, with an eight-team liguilla playoff crowning a champion after each. Until 2011, though, the Mexican league divided its 18 teams into six-team groups. (For reasons I don’t fully understand, they didn’t use the groups to set matchups, just for standings and playoff qualification purposes. That’s where I’d break with them.)MLS should ape the old Primera División format for 2020: Split the league’s 26 teams into four groups — two with six teams and two with seven — and play a 12-match regular season from July 11 through October 3. Everyone plays the teams in their group twice and misses most everyone else. Teams in the two six-team groups would have to play a pair of extra games, which could either be third matches against certain teams in their group, or cross-division games if it makes enough geographic sense. What about the already-played first two weeks of the season? Toss them out. Never happened. Freebies, false memories left over from the Beforetimes. It’s weird to negate results on the field, but we live in weird times. We’re starting a totally new setup for the shortened 2020, and it strikes me as better to ignore the random matches from before the outbreak. (That said, because everyone assumed the games would count when they were played, the league should absolutely count the goals and other statistics for all-time purposes. There’s going to be a lot of footnotes related to 2020, okay?)The top four teams from each group would qualify for the MLS Cup playoffs, which would go on just like last year: a 16-team, one-off knock-out format between the October and November FIFA international windows. MLS Cup would be November 7, allowing for a “normal” offseason before the 2021 season’s late-February start. Even if the timeline to start play slips to August, there’s enough breathing room in a 12-game regular season/4-week playoff format to slide things back several weeks without having to scrap it altogether. The 10 teams that don’t make the playoffs could play a consolation tournament in whatever format you like. It would be a way to keep those teams active during October (and keep gate receipts from plummeting to zero). It would also serve as an opportunity to give young players an extended run-out and give fringe players a potential extended tryout. You could also put some stakes on the line, like preference in the league’s various allocation mechanisms. There are a few different ways you could split the league into four groups. You could draw them randomly, for instance, but that would be hell for travel, which Don Garber and everyone else associated with MLS have been clear is to be avoided. (Something they happen to be right about.)You could keep the conferences together in their current alignment and just cleave each into two. That might serve to preserve current rivalries in some cases, but it would also probably end up with pairings like Miami and Chicago in one group, and Minnesota and Houston in another, which doesn’t make a lot of sense.A better option, I think, would be to remix teams that aren’t right on the West Coast or in the Acela corridor into something more like South and Heartland groups.I admit there are flaws. Salt Lake and Cincinnati aren’t natural rivals. (In my defense, the middle of the country is really big and mostly empty. And I’m from there! Sue me.) And the groups might end up less than super-balanced competitively — I’m looking at you, The South; woof.But, assuming the country can emerge from effective lockdown in time for MLS to resume play in 2020, this is the clearest path forward to both play something like a normal season, with playoffs, in a very limited amount of time. Obviously, this is far from the most pressing matter on anyone’s plate at the moment. But it is a nice distraction from... all this... to think about what will come once sports, and physical human contact, are back. To that end, MLS should dispense with the notion that they’ll be able to fit anything close to a 34-game season and be ready with a new, one-time-only format once the cloud lifts.Till then, stay safe, friends.Like us on Facebook to see similar storiesPlease give an overall site rating:"
0,Baystate Health reports 4 new coronavirus cases in outbreak at Springfield hospital,https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/07/baystate-health-reports-4-new-coronavirus-cases-in-outbreak-at-springfield-hospital.html,"Baystate Medical Center in Springfield.Douglas Hook / MassLiveSPRINGFIELD — Four new cases have been identified in a COVID-19 outbreak at Baystate Medical Center involving more than three dozen employees and patients, Baystate Health President and CEO Dr. Mark Keroack said Tuesday.The new cases bring the total as of Tuesday afternoon to 40. There have been 26 employees and 14 patients infected, said Keroack, who first disclosed the outbreak during the city’s weekly coronavirus update on Monday.None of the employees are hospitalized. Seven of the 14 patients are still hospitalized; most are inpatients who were at the hospital for other conditions.The outbreak appears related to an employee returning to work at Baystate Medical Center after visiting another state identified as a “hot spot” for the virus, Keroack said. The hospital’s review traced the spread to employees — including the worker who traveled out of state — who gathered in break rooms and had removed their masks.“This is something that is disappointing to us,” Keroack said. “We take it very seriously. I think it’s important for us rather than blaming certain individuals who were simply being human at making a mistake, we’ve taken the opportunity to re-examine our policies and procedures and actually charge our team members with coming together.”Before the outbreak, the hospital had issued some guidance to employees about avoiding travel — “but it was pretty soft,” Keroack said.The new requirement is for employees returning to work from states, except in New England, New York and Hawaii, to quarantine for 14 days or produce a negative COVID-19 test. Last week, Gov. Charlie Baker issued a travel order setting similar conditions for visitors to Massachusetts, beginning Aug. 1.Keorack declined again on Tuesday to identify the area of the hospital where the outbreak occurred, but said all employees and patients who might have been exposed have been contacted. The hospital, which is conducting contact tracing, has also extended the testing to anyone, such as the patients’ family and friends, who may have been exposed, he said.The outbreak occurred in a 37-bed unit. Hospital representatives have contacted all 117 patients treated in the unit between July 15 and 23 by phone, Keroack said.Approximately 90 employees worked in the unit, and 100 more visited the unit for more than 15 minutes during the same time period. All have been tested, he said, and most of the test results have come back.“I think there is a lesson,” Keroack said. “You hate to be the cautionary tale, but in fact, I hope what everyone could learn from this is that nobody should think ever that there is any kind of place where people congregate where this virus couldn’t be passed around.”Officials with the hospital and Baystate Health are working with the state Department of Public Health and local boards of health in responding to the outbreak.“DPH is in close contact with Baystate Health in Springfield and collaborating with local health officials to identify possible cases and contacts associated with the outbreak,” said Ann Scales, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health. “The Department will continue to support and provide guidance to local health officials in these communities.”Keroack said he has been very proud of the “extraordinary work” done by the Baystate Health team in response to the pandemic.Related Content:Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our   User Agreement,  Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,  and Your California Privacy Rights  (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.

0,"Children may carry high levels of the coronavirus, up to 100 times as much as adults, new Lurie Childrenâ€™s Hospital study finds",https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-nyt-coronavirus-children-lurie-childrens-hospital-study-20200731-enq5fjcjxzbtvceqombbuekfka-story.html," It has been a comforting refrain in the national conversation about reopening schools: Young children are mostly spared by the coronavirus and don’t seem to spread it to others, at least not very often. But Thursday, a study introduced an unwelcome wrinkle into this smooth narrative. Infected children have at least as much of the coronavirus in their noses and throats as infected adults, according to the research. Indeed, children younger than age 5 may host up to 100 times as much of the virus in the upper respiratory tract as adults, the authors found. That measurement does not necessarily prove that children are passing the virus to others. Still, the findings should influence the debate over reopening schools, several experts said. “The school situation is so complicated. There are many nuances beyond just the scientific one,” said Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, who led the study, published in JAMA Pediatrics. “But one takeaway from this is that we can’t assume that just because kids aren’t getting sick, or very sick, that they don’t have the virus.” The study is not without caveats: It was small and did not specify the participants’ race or sex or whether they had underlying conditions. The tests looked for viral RNA, genetic pieces of the coronavirus, rather than the live virus itself. (Its genetic material is RNA, not DNA.) Still, experts were alarmed to learn that young children may carry significant amounts of the coronavirus. “I’ve heard lots of people saying, ‘Well, kids aren’t susceptible; kids don’t get infected.’ And this clearly shows that’s not true,” said Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. “I think this is an important, really important, first step in understanding the role that kids are playing in transmission.” Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba, said, “Now that we’re rolling into the end of July and looking at trying to open up schools the next month, this really needs to be considered.” The standard diagnostic test amplifies the virus’s genetic material in cycles, with the signal growing brighter each round. The more virus present in the swab initially, the fewer cycles needed for a clear result. Heald-Sargent, who has a research interest in coronaviruses, began noticing that children’s tests were coming back with low “cycle thresholds,” or CTs, suggesting that their samples were teeming with the virus. Intrigued, she called the hospital lab on a Sunday and asked to look back at test results for the past several weeks. “It wasn’t even something we had set out to look for,” she said. She and her colleagues analyzed samples collected with nasopharyngeal swabs between March 23 and April 27 at drive-thru testing sites in Chicago and from people who came to the hospital for any reason, including symptoms of COVID-19. They looked at swabs taken from 145 people: 46 children younger than age 5; 51 children ages 5 to 17; and 48 adults ages 18 to 65. To forestall criticisms that really ill children would be expected to have a lot of the virus, the team excluded children who needed oxygen support. Most of the children in the study reported only a fever or cough, Heald-Sargent said. To compare the groups fairly, the team included only children and adults who had mild to moderate symptoms and for whom they had information about when symptoms began. Heald-Sargent left out people who didn’t have symptoms and who did not remember when they had started to feel ill as well as those who had symptoms for more than a week before the testing. The results confirmed Heald-Sargent’s hunch: Older children and adults had similar CTs, with a median of about 11 and ranging up to 17. But children younger than age 5 had significantly lower CTs of about 6.5. The upper limit of the range in these children was a CT of 12, however — still comparable to those of older children and adults. “It definitely shows that kids do have levels of virus similar to and maybe even higher than adults,” Heald-Sargent said. “It wouldn’t be surprising if they were able to shed” the virus and spread it to others. The results are consistent with those from a German study of 47 infected children between the ages of 1 and 11, which showed that children who did not have symptoms had viral loads as high as adults, or higher. And a recent study from France found that asymptomatic children had CT values similar to those of children with symptoms. CT values are a reasonable proxy for the amount of coronavirus present, said Kindrachuk, who relied on this metric during the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. Still, he and others said that ideally researchers would grow infectious virus from samples, rather than test only for the virus’s RNA. “I suspect that it probably will translate into meaning that there is more actual virus there as well, but we can’t say that without seeing the data,” said Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. Some RNA viruses multiply quickly and are prone to genetic errors that render the virus incapable of infecting cells. Some RNA detected in children may represent these “defective” viruses. “We need to understand how much of that is actually infectious virus,” Schultz-Cherry said. (The researchers said they did not have access to the type of high-security lab required to grow infectious coronavirus, but other teams have cultivated the virus from children’s samples.) The experts all emphasized that the findings at least indicate that children can be infected. Those who harbor a lot of virus may spread it to others in their households or to teachers and other school staff members when schools reopen. Many school districts are planning to protect students and staff members by implementing physical distancing, cloth face coverings and hand hygiene. But it’s unclear how well staff members and teachers can keep young children from getting too close to others, Kindrachuk said. “Frankly, I just haven’t seen a lot of discussion about how that aspect is going to be controlled,” he said. Observations from schools in several countries have suggested that, at least in places with mild outbreaks and preventive measures in place, children do not seem to spread the coronavirus to others efficiently. Strong immune responses in children could limit both how much virus they can spread to others and for how long. The children’s overall health, underlying conditions such as obesity or diabetes, and sex may also influence the ability to transmit the virus. Some experts have suggested that children may transmit less virus because of their smaller lung capacity, height or other physical aspects. Morrison dismissed those suggestions. The virus is shed from the upper respiratory tract, not the lungs, she noted. “We are going to be reopening day care and elementary schools,” she said. If these results hold up, “then, yeah, I’d be worried.” c.2020 The New York Times CompanyCONNECTTRIBUNE PUBLISHINGCOMPANY INFO Copyright © 2020, Chicago Tribune "

0,Six Solutions to the Coronavirus Media Crisis,https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/six-solutions-coronavirus-media-crisis-166371,"The media in crisis is a constant; it was simply amplified by COVID-19.The ongoing, coronavirus-fuelled media crisis has in fact been in the works for more than 30 years. It is not a new phenomenon.In the early 1990s, we saw mergers of major radio networks. The advent of the internet and cable news outlets during the 1990s changed the game and challenged the dominance of news agencies, since audiences had access to live events in real time all the time. The emergence of social media in the 2000s and 2010s continues to transform the role of the media today.The media in crisis is a constant; it was simply amplified by COVID-19. But it’s still taken a toll.More than 135 Canadian media organizations have closed up shop since March 2020. In March and April, 2,000 positions were cut across the country, according to the Canadian Association of Journalists.In the United States, 36,000 journalism jobs have been lost since the beginning of the pandemic, the New York Times reported in April. Poynter has been keeping a running tally of this ever-growing number.The causes of the enduring media crisis worldwide are known: a dramatic drop in advertising revenue for media to the benefit of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, who now share the pie and pay little or no taxes in Canada. But there was also a reluctance to embrace technology by American news organizations, and those in Canada too. The digital shift happened too late in many cases.News media underestimated the role of smartphones: 94 per cent of young readers consume news on their phones or through social media, according to the latest research from the Québec-based CEFRIO research center.News audiences are also more fragmented than ever before, with an increasing number of specialized news sources, whether it’s sports, finance, lifestyle, etc.This overabundance of information has caused some citizens to tune out, overwhelmed by the avalanche of news.Some Successful Models EmergingNonetheless there are some glimmers of hope. Groupe Capitales Médias filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in Québec, but its six newspapers, representing about half of the daily newspapers in the province, were revived as a non-profit co-operative in 2020.There are other business models working well in the country, like the one used by Montréal-based Le Devoir, based on paid subscriptions, advertising and donations. The small newspaper launched its paywall in the 1990s, specialized its content (politics, culture, social issues) and made a major digital shift. This resulted in a $1.6 million surplus in 2019.Are there other possible solutions for solving the crisis in Canada and elsewhere?Six Potential SolutionsHere are some suggestions:The financial media assistance promised by Canada’s federal government ($600 million over five years) has still not arrived, two years after it was announced. That’s shameful. Provincial aid to media organizations — $250 million over five years — is already being distributed in Québec. Government funding remains essential to preserve democracy and fight news deserts.Content monetization: Local media have no other choice but to set up paywalls on their sites and sign piecemeal agreements with Apple News, Facebook and Google News for better revenue-sharing. News organizations also need to attract philanthropic donors and pursue crowd-funding to finance specific news projects that will benefit readers.Diversification of production is necessary. Content needs to be diversified with specialized newsletters, podcasts, videos, event and conference management and brand content that could replace traditional advertising.Value-added content: Media organizations should let news agencies like QMI and The Canadian Press deal with daily breaking news and focus now on long-form journalism, investigative reporting, features, interviews, newsletters, explanatory content, etc. This will force media organizations to value data-driven, investigative and solutions journalism. Now more than ever, citizens want to read content that’s thoughtful, important or hopeful.Tackling fake news and distrust in the media is paramount. There needs to be an active push against the prevailing public cynicism by employing more fact-checking, possibly with the help of artificial intelligence. Media organizations also need to reconnect with their audiences, young people in particular, by covering a wider range of topics. In classrooms, we must set up civic media education seminars to demystify the work of journalists and the media.There is a severe lack of diversity in newsrooms across Canada, especially Québec. There are not enough journalists from racialized groups and Indigenous communities. There will need to be a profound change on this issue all across Canada so that news organizations reflect the country’s population and report on the issues that matter to diverse audiences.Reinvention NeededThere’s no question media organizations must reinvent themselves, and have needed to both before COVID-19 and today.But the situation is not desperate. Traffic on news sites has been up sharply since the beginning of the pandemic, but it’s not well-monetized.News organizations must go where readers are: on their phones. News sites have to be more user-friendly in terms of design — the recent success of the myFT app from the Financial Times in this regard is a great example of what works.Whether there will be media mergers or other closures this year, or in 2021, remains to be seen. But in the meantime, we can make better use of technology by using automation for certain content (sports and financial news; translations) in order to free up newsroom reporters to focus on value-added journalism.Hopefully alliances and collaborations can also be formed among local media outlets across the country and national news organizations that could entail sharing content or other technology-based partnerships. A current example is the Local Journalism Initiative in Canada, operating via The Canadian Press to support local and civic journalism for under-served communities.There is nothing to lose and everything to gain in working hand and hand, together, to reimagine journalism in Canada. COVID-19 has simply reminded us to make it a top priority.Patrick White, professeur de journalisme , Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM)This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Teachers across the country report their attempts at distance learning induced by the pandemic are failing to reach large numbers of students. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)BOSTON (Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care) – Governor Charlie Baker signed an executive order Thursday authorizing the Department of Early Education and Care to establish emergency sites for children and youth living in residential homes that have tested positive for COVID-19 and need to be cared for in quarantine or isolation.  The Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) is responsible for the licensing and oversight of residential programs and group homes, providing 24-hour custodial care and social services to children cared for by the Department of Children and Families (DCF), the Department of Development Services (DDS), the Department of Mental Health (DMH), the Department of Youth Services (DYS), and other organizations. EEC also works with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) to license residential schools. These programs remain open throughout the State of Emergency and will continue to do so. Some existing facilities do not have the capability to effectively isolate and quarantine individuals who have been exposed or tested positive for COVID-19. The goal of the temporary emergency residential sites is to accommodate the needs of COVID-19-exposed youth who cannot stay in their current residential placement. The order gives EEC the authority to do the following:“In these unprecedented times, the dedication of our residential program providers and educators has been truly commendable,” said Early Education and Care Commissioner Samantha Aigner-Treworgy. “With today’s executive order, Governor Baker has enabled the Department of Early Education and Care to meet the needs of this community head-on.”Any provider interested in operating a temporary emergency residential site may apply on the EEC COVID-19 website.Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

of the Los Altos Town CrierThe Rotary Club of Los Altos, like other service organizations, is improvising in the face of pandemic-induced restrictions.The club’s Thursday lunches, long a staple for members, are not going to waste. To keep its caterer, Cafe Primavera, in business during the lockdown, Rotarians established a drive-thru meal pickup, are delivering them to members who cannot pick them up and are donating the surplus to the Day Worker Center of Mountain View.Los Altos Rotary president Bonnie Burdett-Walker proposed reinventing the lunch program, which served members at their Thursday meetings at the Shoup Park Garden House before the shelter-in-place orders.The idea proved a win-win: support Cafe Primavera and donate excess meals to people in need.“The great thing about Rotary is when people have a great idea, we just make it happen,” said club lunch organizer Sandy Mingia. “It means we are able to move very quickly.”Mingia and fellow Rotarian Cindy Bogard-O’Gorman took Burdett-Walker’s idea and ran with it. Since mid-April, the meals have been feeding 150 people – many of them homeless – through the Day Worker Center. Club president-elect Kathy Berry delivers meals to the porches of Rotarians who want them but for various reasons cannot travel to the drive-thru lunch line, set up near the Los Altos Chamber of Commerce. Berry drops the meals off at seniors’ residences and the house of a working family with a mother who provides front-line care.“The Wednesday deliveries represent more than just another meal, it provides something to look forward to,” Berry said. “Every time I deliver the meals and return to my car, I see each recipient waving to me from his or her door.  Sometimes we have a short chat. …  It reminds me of the adage that we are not here to serve ourselves; we are here to serve others.”The club continues to provide aid to organizations like the Day Worker Center through the Los Altos Rotary Community Action Team (LARCAT), formed after the coronavirus hit Santa Clara County, with the purpose of helping those hit hardest by lost wages and health concerns. LARCAT collects money from members who can afford to donate, and some have contributed even before being asked, Mingia said. Others who can’t contribute financially show up ready to work.“We look to serve our grantees during this time but have expanded to first responders,” Mingia said.LARCAT has donated pizzas to the Los Altos and Mountain View police departments, the Santa Clara County Fire Department and El Camino Hospital staff.Rotarians also have contributed to feed kids in the Mentor Tutor Connection program, a Town Crier Holiday Fund recipient, and organized a blood drive with the city of Los Altos and the Kiwanis Club in late April.“It’s amazing that we are going into our third month doing this,” Mingia said. “It’s amazing how quickly four weeks goes by, because I have to go back to everyone and say, ‘I need more money.’ But our people have been so generous, so kind.”To contribute to LARCAT, visit bit.ly/3dh5HnI.Los Altos Town Crier"

0,"In the era of COVID-19, states need practical solutions to address health care costs",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/in-the-era-of-covid-19-states-need-practical-solutions-to-address-health-care-costs/ar-BB158AXl,"The vast human and economic devastation of the coronavirus is evident in the numbers: more than 100,000 American lives lost, 1.9 million infected and a national unemployment rate of 13.3 percent. While the curve appears to be slowly flattening, it goes without saying that the fallout will be substantial, particularly for states and communities.When it comes to overall health care spending, COVID-19 will further exacerbate already strained state budgets, particularly as millions of Americans shift from commercial insurance to Medicaid. Recent analyses by multiple think tanks indicate that tens of millions of Americans could lose their employer-sponsored health coverage. Directly and indirectly, this shift puts the onus on states to find savings without cutting benefits.The first priority is, of course, supporting biopharmaceutical scientists who are working to produce treatments and a vaccine that will save lives and alter the trajectory of COVID-19. However, we also have the opportunity to seek improvements in the broader system that patients, businesses and government rely upon. For Americans of all ages, this begins with reducing cost wherever it exists.One straightforward example is rethinking the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), health insurance middlemen that exist to negotiate drug pricing between drug manufacturers, health plans and pharmacies. PBMs have historically played an important role in controlling costs, particularly at the pharmacy counter. But they have been criticized in recent years for engaging in a number of backroom business tactics that result in higher costs for patients, negotiated rebates going directly to a PBM's bottom line, financial strain for many independent pharmacists and drug formularies that lead to unnecessary access restrictions for patients.Herein lies a unique option: requiring that PBMs become pharmacy benefit administrators (PBAs), which would give these companies fiduciary responsibility and make them accountable to the plans - and patients - that they serve.Over the past few years, several states have introduced legislation to hold PBMs accountable, bolster state budgets and help make it easier to pass savings along to patients. New Jersey passed and implemented a reverse auction that is saving the state $2.5 billion over five years. Maryland passed a similar bill in the past several weeks. In 2018, I worked with Secretary Azar to develop a proposal that would have delivered the most meaningful change on drug costs in decades. This remains important and states need this now more than ever.How would a PBA model work? For starters, it would automatically rid the system of rebates that are driving up costs at the pharmacy counter, and convert them to savings for consumers and employers. Research published recently by the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics suggests a $1 increase in rebates is associated with a $1.17 increase in list price. Consider the example of Humalog, a popular insulin medication: on average, the monthly net price (the real-world cost) for the drug was $135 per patient in 2018 compared with an average list price of $594. There is little reason to doubt that most patients would pay closer to the net price if their insurer used a PBA.Improved access is another likely result. A recent bipartisan letter asked Secretary Azar and Administrator Verma why only six percent of patients with high cholesterol could get PCSK9s for a copay less than $50. A recent Avalere analysis shows the situation may be improving as one-third of all Medicare Part D beneficiaries can now find these drugs on the preferred brand tier. But when drug companies lowered the list price of PCSK9s by 60 percent, many Part D plans moved these drugs to non-preferred tiers, which often cost patients more money.Finally, PBAs wouldn't be incentivized to negotiate deals that would favor one company or treatment just because of market share or sheer patient volume. Just the opposite, formularies would better reflect the latest innovation that we're seeing across a number of disease areas, including cancer, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Makers of these treatments would compete on offering the greatest efficacy with the fewest side effects at the lowest net cost.Democrats and Republicans deserve credit for working together to lower out-of-pocket costs. As COVID-19 creates a new set of challenges and opportunities for our health care system, particularly in the states, the one change that would benefit just about everyone who purchases medicines - individuals, companies, state governments, and many others - begins with a new approach for PBMs. We can all agree that breakthrough innovation doesn't belong in a system where the middleman adds cost.

and aged care facilities across Victoria have tested positive to COVID-19, as the number of new coronavirus cases in the state continues to climb.Victoria recorded 134 new coronavirus cases overnight, the third day in a row of increases over 100.Only 11 of the new infections are linked to known outbreaks, while the rest are still under investigation by health officials.The new infections include four patients and one staff member at the Brunswick Private Hospital in Melbourne's inner north.The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said contact tracing was underway at the hospital.""The outbreak squad will visit today and the hospital is closed to new admissions,"" DHHS said.A doctor from St Vincent's Hospital, two staff members from The Alfred Hospital, one from the Royal Melbourne Hospital and one from the Royal Women's have also all tested positive to coronavirus.A spokesperson from St Vincent's said the doctor was in one of the acute medical teams.""There has been no operational impact on our services,"" the spokesperson said.Fifteen employees from St Vincent's are in self-quarantine.Internal emails from the chief executive of the Royal Melbourne Hospital seen by the ABC said a staff member from the Royal Melbourne and one from the Royal Women's Hospital both tested positive for coronavirus last weekend.Both staff members had attended face-to-face training at the Royal Melbourne Hospital prior to being diagnosed.A spokesperson from The Alfred said contract tracing was underway but at this stage, it was unclear if the staff members contracted the virus while working at the hospital.A number of other workers have been sent home to self-isolate.""Staff in all clinical areas at Alfred Health are now required to wear a surgical mask to increase their protection against COVID-19,"" the spokesperson said.It follows the ABC being told only ambulances with code-one emergencies were being taken to the Northern Hospital's emergency room, after eight staff and one of their household contacts tested positive to COVID-19 earlier this week.All staff were being tested and contact tracing was underway at what was usually Victoria's busiest emergency department, a spokesperson said on Monday night.A number of aged care facilities are being cleaned and their residents tested in the wake of workers and residents testing positive.The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said the infections were:The department said another person who tested positive to coronavirus provided aged care services to clients in their homes through Mercy Health.#growthfactorgraphicEMBEDfull""Cleaning, contact tracing and appropriate testing is underway"" at the facilities, the department said.The ABC has confirmed another infection in a staff member who worked at the Aurrum aged care facility in Healesville, north-east of Melbourne.An email from the facility said the staff member was not believed to have been showing symptoms when they were last in contact with any other team members or residents.""As a precaution, we are today undertaking a routine baseline set of observations for all residents, which includes blood pressure, temperature, and pulse,"" chief executive Craig Rutherford said.""We ask that everyone continue to follow the COVID-safe infection control practices, including social distancing, visiting only in designated outdoor areas or residents' rooms, hand washing and the use of hand gel sanitiser.""Another paramedic also tested positive on Wednesday, the fifth to contract the virus since the pandemic

0,Malort made from beer released Friday as a creative solution to a serious problem: kegs expiring due to coronavirus,https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/companies/malort-made-from-beer-released-friday-as-a-creative-solution-to-a-serious-problem-kegs-expiring-due-to-coronavirus/ar-BB14r3hE,"When a pandemic hands you old beer, you don’t make lemonade. You make Malort.Load ErrorIn this case, the old beer was 160 kegs of Revolution Brewing’s flagship Anti-Hero IPA that were about to fall out of code while most bars and restaurants remain closed to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.Rather than dump the beer, Revolution teamed up with Chicago’s CH Distillery to create a first: Malort made from beer.The product, which goes on sale Friday at Revolution, CH Distillery and Binny’s, pairs two modern Chicago icons: the city’s top-selling craft beer and the city’s most iconic spirit, an intensely bitter liqueur that doubles as a civic badge of pride.But it’s also a playful solution to a serious problem for breweries large and small: What to do with all those useless kegs?As stay-at-home orders took root, breweries mostly stopped filling kegs as almost all beer sales in the U.S. shifted to bottles and cans. But hundreds of thousands of kegs were already filled, waiting to head into the market. The smallest breweries have repurposed some of that beer for sales in cans. Others have donated kegs to turn beer into hand sanitizer.The majority of kegs, however, won’t be salvaged. As they go out of code, breweries and wholesalers have hatched plans to deal with an unprecedented issue.Lester Jones, chief economist for the National Beer Wholesalers Association, said about 10 million gallons of beer — the equivalent of about 645,000 standard-sized kegs and valued at about $1 billion — were stranded in the market as shutdown orders took effect in mid-March.A small amount of beer already on tap was sold in growlers by bars and restaurants, Jones said. But the vast majority needed somewhere to go as it became clear it would never reach beer drinkers before expiring.Solving the problem has amounted to shared sacrifice between breweries and their distributors.Anheuser-Busch, Molson Coors and Heineken USA all have said they will split the cost with distributors to pull back out-of-code kegs. Constellation Brands, which makes leading Mexican brands including Modelo and Corona for the U.S. market, has said it will cover 70% of the cost of returned kegs.Craft breweries including New Glarus and Summit have pledged to absorb all the cost of recalling out-of-code kegs.“It’s going to be a back-breaking chore to extract all those kegs from all those independent bars and taverns,” Jones said. “That’ll be a lot of work and it won’t be as easy as driving up to the local stadium and unloading a bunch of kegs.”Revolution Brewing founder Josh Deth said his brewery will split the cost 50-50 with distributors, which maps out to a loss of more than $50 per keg for each party. He said there are more than 1,000 kegs of Anti-Hero in the market that will need to be resolved — plus other Revolution brands.“We have budgeted several hundred thousand (dollars), but won’t know for sure (the impact) until the kegs all come back,” Deth said.Malort made from Anti-Hero was intended to be a fun solution to the vexing problem. Revolution and CH Distillery each will donate $5,000 of proceeds from the project to the Comp Tab Relief Fund, which supports workers in the hospitality industry.“It was never about making us whole on the financial side,” Deth said. “It’s more like we’re bored and we had all this beer.”As kegs of Anti-Hero sat at the brewery, Deth reached out to CH founder Tremaine Atkinson in April with the idea of distilling something from the beer, though he wasn’t sure what.“You hate to see something you value wasted — that’s the biggest thing,"" Deth said.Efficiency, he said, “is in the lifeblood of the brewer; no one wants to waste beer at this point.”Atkinson suggested they make Malort. The bottles will retail for $25, a $5 increase from the standard bottle of Malort. Deth and Atkinson will discuss the collaboration Saturday at 4 p.m. on a web chat hosted by the Chicago Brewseum.Revolution sent several workers to the Pilsen distillery across multiple days for the effort. Atkinson said he hoped to tease out new flavors in Malort, a product known largely for its mouth-twisting bitterness.They separated the distillate into three flavor profiles — malty-sweet, floral-hoppy and bitter-hoppy — then blended the three to a result that accents Anti-Hero’s malty character as well as the floral notes from its hops, Atkinson said.Hops also lend bitterness, which accents the bitterness already present in Malort due to its herbaceous key ingredient, wormwood.“At first it’s like, ‘OK, that’s Malort,’ and then 30 seconds later you’re like, ‘Holy (expletive), that’s bitter,’"" Atkinson said. “It bites hard at the end.”IPA-distilled Malort is the second major diversion for the brand during the pandemic. Last month, CH introduced Malort hand sanitizer, which was initially available only as a donated product to health care workers.Malort hand sanitizer has since been made available to the public via CH Distillery, seven Ace Hardware stores, Fringe/A hair salon, Dark Matter Coffee and breweries including Pipeworks, Lo Rez and Haymarket.Atkinson said he has another 160 kegs of Anti-Hero that he would like to use to make a schnapps. Whether he makes another Malort from beer is to be determined.“We’re not planning to make it an ongoing product, but I could see maybe doing it again next year,” he said. “Then again, there won’t be all this waste beer next year — knock on any hard surface.”jbnoel@chicagotribune.com———©2020 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Like us on Facebook to see similar storiesPlease give an overall site rating:"

LOS ANGELES, June  09, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – Prior to COVID-19, global efforts to reduce plastic waste were making powerful headway. More than half a year into the pandemic, those hard-won efforts are now threatened by significant increases in plastic waste from personal protective equipment (PPE) and the explosive demand for sanitizers, most of which are packaged in HDPE and PET. The need for plastic alternatives has never been greater.On par with global measures to cut plastic pollution – such as bans on plastic shopping bags and single-use drinking straws – California-based start-up Circular Centric Inc. created a unique strategy to control the lifecycle of 100% compostable plant-based products developed in partnership with Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a world leading R&D institution working with companies such as Microsoft, Intel and Qualcomm, with high-profile spinoffs including Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd., Acer and HTC.In late 2019, Circular Centric purchased two manufacturing facilities in California to produce bottles and disposable products made from its proprietary technology. Following the coronavirus pandemic, the company has expanded efforts to develop and introduce a new line of USDA/EPA Curative Biocentric 100% all-natural certified sanitizer formulation, in compostable bottles and enabled with a blockchain traceability solution. As of June 2020, these FDA-certified manufacturing facilities are on track to produce and fill 18 million 2- and 8-oz bottles with sanitizer per month.The company then advanced on its objective to reduce plastic waste, establishing a partnership with Chrome Diagnostics for the distribution of its unique sanitizer from Circular Centric’s FDA-certified manufacturing facilities. The companies are now providing to universities and school systems across the nation superior-grade hand sanitizers packaged in BPI-certified compostable bottles.Circular Centric – Key Highlights 
Addressing the Plastic PandemicThe global hand sanitizer market on pace to reach $7.3 billion by 2027, according to Reports and Data. Most hand sanitizer bottles are made of recyclable plastic, but no plastic is biodegradable. The allure of compostable packaging is its ability to breakdown into natural elements within a couple years; in an industrial composting facility, the process is even faster.Sadly, many bottles of hand sanitizer used through the pandemic and years following will never see a recycling or composting facility. This is where Circular Centric’s technology wields incredible potential.In August 2020, the company will begin manufacturing bottles made from PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate), a naturally occurring, compostable bio-polymer. If a bottle of Circular Centric’s PHA bottle finds its way into the ocean, the bottle will break down into CO2, water and organic waste in as little as four to five months. This capability has the potential for tremendous implication in the global push to keep plastic out of our oceans.COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on economies and healthcare systems around the world. Its impact on our environment has yet to be seen, but environmentalists are sounding the alarms of devasting amounts of plastic pollution. Circular Centric’s approach to compostable packaging ensures its role as part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.
    Quality Confirmed by BlockchainThe hand sanitizer market is inundated with low-quality, low-cost hand sanitizer products with alcohol percentages well below CDC’s recommendations of at least 50%. Circular Centric’s line of USDA BPI-certified products are backed by blockchain smart technology servicing the circular environment as an authenticity and traceability solution that enables consumers to track the history of the product for quality validation and counterfeit and fraud prevention. Each bottle of Curative Biocentric hand sanitizer features a blockchain-backed QR code that when scanned leads the consumer to a landing page detailing the product’s ingredients and certifications (EPA, FDA and USDA). The end goal is a high-quality product that earns consumer loyalty and reduces plastic waste. With blockchain technology and the highest industry standards certificates, we prove sustainability performance impact traceable, measurable, and credible.About Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)Founded in 1973 in Taiwan, the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) is a non-profit RTO dedicated to spearheading emerging high technology industry and enhancing the competitiveness of existing industries. R&D in ITRI encompasses six technology areas: information & communications, electronics & optoelectronics, advanced manufacturing, biomedical & devices, material & chemicals, and energy & environment. with over 28,000 patents, 6,800 scientists, 3,200 of which hold advanced PhD degrees, ITRI is recognized as one of world leading research Institutes.

When I woke up, they told me 2.5 million. I was like, 'what? Are you serious?'"" Rogan, 29, told ABC 7 News.As of Tuesday, there have been more than 4.7 million positive cases of COVID-19 in the United States, and more than 157,000 deaths related to the virus, according to data from the New York Times. YouTube  Chris Rogan being discharged from hospitalRELATED: Texas Woman Writes Viral Obit Naming President Trump for Husband's 'Needless' COVID-19 DeathDuring his hospitalization, Rogan was intubated twice and spent a total of 71 days with a tube in his throat.

""Until the surgical team was like, 'does it still feel like there's a leg there?' and I was like, 'what? What do you mean, is there still a leg there?'

0,Housing as Health Care: Advocates Press for COVID Crisis Solutions,https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2020-04-09/housing-homelessness/housing-as-health-care-advocates-press-for-covid-crisis-solutions/a69845-1,"
*These fields are requiredThe next Congress will see a record number of women representing their states; the impact of ""baseless"" voter fraud claims.Georgia's re-counting ballots for president for their post-election audit. And progressive groups recommend candidates for cabinet and other top government positions. BOSTON -- Housing advocates say the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be contained until everyone has the ability to isolate -- and that means everyone must have an affordable place to live. 

Experts on low-income housing are speaking out, emphasizing that housing is tied to health care. 

Dr. Megan Sandel, an associate professor at Boston University Schools of Medicine and Public Health, says the stress of being homeless or close to it damages people's health and makes them more susceptible to the virus.  

""These are pre-COVID era, and you know that millions more families are going to be behind on rent and suffer the same types of adverse outcomes that we associate with homelessness,"" she points out.

Advocates praise the CARES Act, which put billions of dollars toward homeless shelters and rental assistance, but they say more will be needed. 

They note that pre-COVID, widespread poverty and a massive shortage of low-income housing means millions of Americans have no cushion to absorb the shock of losing their job during the public-health lockdown.

Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, praises states and cities that have passed moratoria on foreclosures and evictions, but she says Congress needs to enact a national policy so millions who've lost their jobs and can't pay rent aren't thrown out on the street.

""We are pushing for there to be a national uniform policy that assures everybody in the country that we won't lose our homes in the midst of a pandemic,"" she stresses.

Douglas Bibby, president of the National Multifamily Housing Council, says his organization is encouraging landlords to be flexible with tenants. But he adds that apartment building owners need assistance, so they can keep the lights on.

""If the apartment owners cannot get forbearance, then literally a lot of them are going to go out of business,"" he states.

Congress is now working on a fourth COVID response bill. 

Housing advocates are pressing for another $100 billion for rental assistance and for a ban on law enforcement sweeps of homeless encampments.

Local foster care and adoption advocates say they are bracing for an increase in the number of children needing foster homes as the state begins to reopen. However, COVID-19 has impacted the adoption and foster care process.Companies offering help during coronavirus pandemicAccording to Focus on the Family Program Director, Dr. Sharen Ford, the pandemic has put a bigger focus on making sure a home is safe before a child is brought in.

0,Covid-19: Those waiting for Australian citizenship ceremonies demand 'New Zealand like' alternative,https://www.sbs.com.au/language/english/audio/covid-19-those-waiting-for-australian-citizenship-ceremonies-demand-new-zealand-like-alternative,"After the cancellation of citizenship ceremonies by the councils across Australia, applicants who have already been approved are asking for an alternative way to formalise their citizenship.Suman Verma* arrived in Australia with her husband in June 2015 and applied for Australian citizenship after becoming eligible four years later.“We passed the test, appeared for the interview and received the approval almost three hours later. We were very excited,” says Suman.The excitement was short-lived as the coronavirus outbreak halted the process. Most councils around Australia cancelled their citizenship ceremonies after the federal government recommended all organised non-essential public gatherings involving more than 500 people be cancelled on 16 March 2020.What was a precautionary measure has now intensified, with gatherings of two or more people for non-essential purpose now prohibited.It has left hundreds in limbo as citizenship ceremonies have been cancelled indefinitely.“There were people who had received citizenship invites too. They were waiting for the ceremony to receive their citizenship certificates,” Suman Verma told SBS Hindi.Now many of these people have requested the Department of Home Affairs to find an alternative solution to the delay.Those who have already been approved by the Department of Home Affairs and are only waiting for a citizenship ceremony to become Australian Citizens, have requested the government via an online petition for ‘an alternative way to formalise the citizenship.’“All of us signing this petition have already passed our citizenship tests and interviews, and have been approved by the department. Most of us have also been waiting to formalise our commitment to Australia for at least four to five years, and we’re very much looking forward to our citizenship ceremonies to officially formalise our commitment to this great nation,” reads the petition that has already been signed by hundreds.The petition suggests following New Zealand's move to formalise citizenship without holding ceremonies.Suman Verma says the New Zealand Government has taken the lead in this issue.“They introduced an alternative method on 16 March 2020 to allow approved applicants to become citizens by waiving the public ceremony requirement and sending their citizenship certificates via post,” said Ms Verma.The notification published on the Immigration New Zealand website reads:“Attending a ceremony is usually the final step in your citizenship journey. In response to COVID-19, we are following advice from the Ministry of Health to postpone large public gatherings. There will be no citizenship ceremonies until further notice. If you have been approved for a grant of citizenship, the Citizenship Office will instead send your citizenship certificate by courier post.”Migration law expert Abul Rizvi says this could be a feasible option.“There is no reason that I am aware of that Australia could not follow the same process. Once the person has already been approved of the grant of citizenship, the ceremony is exactly that, a ceremonial process.""If there is a regulation in the citizenship act preventing that, I will be surprised if the minister couldn’t readily make an amendment to that regulation,” Mr Rizvi told SBS Hindi.He says the department has a considerable backlog and clearing some of them surely would help the department itself.“If you think of the number of people around the world, who actually obtain citizenship while staying outside the country, I cannot imagine that the ceremony is required.“I am sure there are circumstances where people have had citizenship certificates delivered in that way,” said Mr Rizvi.The petitioners argue that having their citizenship process put on hold is now adding to an already stressful situation.“We believe that implementing an alternative method to formalise citizenships (rather than the traditional public ceremony) would not only help relieve the stress of all applicants who are currently on hold but would also help all government parties involved to maximise resources and therefore make them available to be reallocated,” reads the petition.SBS Hindi has approached the Department of Home Affairs for a comment, and the response is awaited.*Name has been changed due to privacy.People in Australia must stay at least 1.5 metres away from others and gatherings are limited to two people unless you are with your family or household.If you believe you may have contracted the virus, call your doctor, don’t visit, or contact the national Coronavirus Health Information Hotline on 1800 020 080.If you are struggling to breathe or experiencing a medical emergency, call 000.Tune into SBS Hindi at 5 pm every day and follow us on Facebook and TwitterSBS acknowledges the traditional owners of country throughout Australia."

The new centre is one of 16 set up across the region as more cases of Covid-19 were reported in the community. Another new centre opened at the Mangere town centre car park to meet demand at 10am. On Wednesday, more than 7800 tests were registered by Auckland labs – a record number. READ MORE: * Coronavirus: Eight hour wait at the Hamilton Covid-19 testing station * Coronavirus: Queues stretch nearly 1km at Covid-19 testing stations * Coronavirus: Long queues at Covid-19 testing stations as NZ moves alert levels * Coronavirus: Where to get tested for Covid-19 in Auckland  The new Eden Park testing centre – in the stadium’s bus hub on the corner of Sandringham Rd and Reimers Ave – was set up to replace the testing centre on New North Rd in Eden Terrace. The Super Rugby Aotearoa game between the Blues and the Crusaders, scheduled to be played on Sunday at the stadium, will be cancelled if level 3 lockdown restrictions remain in place - or indeed Auckland moves to level 4. Before the gates opened to the testing centre on Friday morning, there were already lines of cars waiting to be let in. A line of people in masks had also formed for the centre’s walk-in service. Portaloos have also been set up along the entrance in preparation for long wait times. By 9am the queues at the Eden Park testing centre went around the block. A Year 13 student from Mount Albert Grammar School (MAGS) was one of those waiting in line with his older sister since 8am. “I’m a student at MAGS and I started experiencing some Covid-like symptoms, coughing, a sore throat, so I thought I’d better get tested.” He said the identity of the student who first tested positive was being kept a secret to protect them, but he didn’t believe he was a close contact. “Still, I think if you go to MAGS and you have any symptoms you should definitely come and get checked.” Marie Simpson had also been waiting in line for around an hour and had a connection to MAGS. “I had some contact with children who go to the school last week. When I heard about the cluster I thought I better get tested.” The Northern Region Health Coordination Centre said the new site provided better flow and a safer environment for pedestrians seeking testing than the Eden Terrace site. “With good access to public transport, the Eden Park pop-up CTC will also be well set up for pedestrian ‘walk-ups’ to obtain a test.” Eden Park chief executive Nick Sautner said he was pleased it could play a small part in assisting Government, and the city of Auckland, by supporting testing requirements. “Based on planning to date, the community testing centre will remain in place during Alert Level 3 only and under these current restrictions the Super Rugby Aotearoa fixture cannot proceed this weekend.” On Thursday, members of the community who visited the New North Rd site contacted Stuff to say they were refused a test because they were not in a car. One man with a cold, who didn’t want to be named, said he walked to the testing station and lined up before 8am. More than 50 people in the line, wearing face masks and standing two metres apart, were told to leave because they weren't in cars. The man questioned how people were supposed to get tested if they didn't have a car – but the person who told him to leave didn’t give him an answer. “It doesn’t make sense. There are a lot of students who live in the city and don't own cars.”Stuff© 2020 Stuff Limited"

Face masks will be de rigueur, people may be ""trapped indoors for months,"" and crowded public events are out, science reporter Donald McNeil Jr. writes at The New York Times, citing more than 20 health and science experts. Until there's a vaccine, ""if Americans pour back out in force, all will appear quiet for perhaps three weeks. Then the emergency rooms will get busy again.""Among the many things we don't yet understand about this new coronavirus is how deadly it is or how many people have been infected. ""Fatality rates depend heavily on how overwhelmed hospitals get and what percentage of cases are tested,"" and those numbers keep getting revised in hard-hit areas, McNeil reports. People who die of the disease at home or in overwhelmed hospitals are not counted, but people with few or no symptoms are never tested, so ""if you don't know how many people are infected, you don't know how deadly a virus is.""The changing fatality rate is one reason the models keep fluctuating, McNeil says, but ""there may be good news buried in this inconsistency: The virus may also be mutating to cause fewer symptoms. In the movies, viruses become more deadly. In reality, they usually become less so, because asymptomatic strains reach more hosts. Even the 1918 Spanish flu virus eventually faded into the seasonal H1N1 flu.""While we don't know the fatality rate or level of contagion, the ""refrigerated trucks parked outside hospitals tell us all we need to know: It is far worse than a bad flu season,"" McNeil writes. How the pandemic ends depends on the virus' lethality, medical advances, and how individuals behave, he adds. ""If we scrupulously protect ourselves and our loved ones, more of us will live. If we underestimate the virus, it will find us."" Peter WeberKarl Rove, a Fox News contributor and one of the most prominent Republican strategists, gently told President Trump and his supporters in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Wednesday evening that the presidential race is over and Trump lost. Republicans did much better than expected on Election Day, but ""the White House changed hands,"" he writes. No amount of legal jujitsu will change that, Rove explained:Mr. Trump is now pursuing legal challenges in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada, and there will be an automatic recount in Georgia, given Mr. Biden's 0.29-point lead there. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is correct that Mr. Trump is ""100 percent within his rights"" to go to court over concerns about fraud and transparency. But the president's efforts are unlikely to move a single state from Mr. Biden's column, and certainly they're not enough to change the final outcome. [Karl Rove, The Wall Street Journal]Rove said Biden has insurmountable leads in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, enough to give him 306 electoral votes, unless Trump can somehow ""prove systemic fraud, with illegal votes in the tens of thousands. There is no evidence of that so far."" Once Trump's ""days in court are over,"" he added, ""the president should do his part to unite the country by leading a peaceful transition and letting grievances go.""Fox News — owned, like the Journal, by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire, called the race for Biden on Saturday, but its prime-time opinion hosts have been slow to recognize Trump's defeat. One of them, Fox News regular Geraldo Rivera, also told Trump it's time to move on late Wednesday. Peter WeberJust curious: who are you defining as “our enemies”? https://t.co/I15QIXibeL— Daniel W. Drezner (@dandrezner) November 12, 2020Privately, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien is open about President Trump losing the election and the need to start a transition with President-elect Joe Biden, one official told The Daily Beast, but he won't say anything about the matter to Trump's face.Multiple officials told The Daily Beast that O'Brien has been enabling Trump and his refusal to concede the election. He has urged national security staffers to go along with Trump's false claims about widespread voter fraud, the officials said. O'Brien has also spent the last several months complaining about Mark Esper, who Trump fired as defense secretary earlier this week, and he has supported Trump installing loyalists in top Pentagon positions.One former national security official told The Daily Beast it's not surprising that O'Brien is behaving this way, as he is a yes man who ""does whatever Trump says."" Several officials also said the name ""Biden"" can't be uttered these days, with one national security official claiming that if ""you even mention Biden's name ... you'd be fired. Everyone is scared of even talking about the chance of working with the [Biden] transition."" A White House official told The Daily Beast — only half kidding — that in the West Wing, you can say Biden's name, but only if ""you're talking about who lost the election to the president."" Catherine GarciaOregon highway workers had to find a way to dispose of the rotting carcass of a 45-foot-long, eight ton whale in Florence, the closest beach town to Eugene, on Nov. 12, 1970. They decided to obliterate it using 20 cases — half a ton — of dynamite. ""The hope was that the long-dead Pacific gray whale would be almost disintegrated by the blast, and that any small pieces still around after the explosion would be taken care of by seagulls and other scavengers,"" explained KATU's Paul Linnman, in what New York Times reporter Mike Baker calls ""surely one of the greatest local TV news segments of the century."" And not because things went as planned. Watch below.

There has also been a sharp increase in the daily number of deaths, with at least 1,408 people dying on Wednesday, including a record number in Minnesota, Alabama, and Tennessee. ""The cat's already out of the bag,"" Albert Ko, an infectious disease physician at the Yale School of Public Health, told the Post. ""We're having widespread transmission. It's going to get worse, certainly, for the next month.""Health experts warn that because of the holidays and colder temperatures, the number of cases will likely increase dramatically, as people ignore advice and gather in larger groups inside. ""The worst of this crisis is playing out in the next six to eight weeks,"" David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Post. ""The irony is, this is the time we most need our public leadership. Right now."" President Trump is not focusing on the coronavirus pandemic, instead spending his days tweeting baseless claims about widespread voter fraud.Hospitals across the United States are preparing for a surge in patients, moving doctors to different department and hiring traveling nurses. Most are still dealing with not having enough personal protective equipment like masks and gloves, and that's ""a grave concern,"" Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told the Post. ""When we first saw the pandemic start in the spring, it was on a rolling basis — some cases in Washington, others in New York. Now we're seeing increases everywhere. We are seeing hospitals being strained across the country. What we're seeing is not only burnout but a lot of complications having stress on medical professionals for an extended period of time."" Catherine GarciaPresident-elect Joe Biden announced Wednesday night that he has chosen Ron Klain as his White House chief of staff, saying Klain has been ""invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together,"" including during the 2009 economic downturn and 2014 Ebola outbreak.After graduating from Harvard Law, Klain joined Biden's Senate team in 1989. Klain has spent the last several decades active in Democratic politics, and he was ""Ebola czar"" for former President Barack Obama during his second term.In a statement, Biden said Klain's ""deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again.""Klain called it an ""honor of a lifetime to serve President-elect Biden in this role, and I am humbled by his confidence."" On Twitter, he thanked people for their ""kind wishes"" and said he ""will give my all to lead a talented and diverse team in a Biden-Harris"" White House. Catherine GarciaPresident-elect Joe Biden has selected Ron Klain to be his White House chief of staff, several people with knowledge of the matter told The New York Times. Klain is a lawyer who served as ""Ebola czar"" during former President Barack Obama's second term, leading efforts to guide the country through an outbreak of the disease. In the late 1980s, after graduating from Harvard Law, Klain went to work for Biden, then a senator representing Delaware, and they have remained close confidants ever since.Biden could publicly name Klain as his chief of staff as early as Thursday morning. The president-elect is expected to announce several top White House staffers in the next few days, but advisers say he likely won't share his Cabinet picks until closer to Thanksgiving. Catherine GarciaArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) shot down conspiracy theories surrounding the state and how it ran its election, telling Fox Business host Neil Cavuto on Wednesday afternoon that ""if indeed there was some great conspiracy, it apparently didn't work.""As of Wednesday morning, President-elect Joe Biden leads President Trump by fewer than 13,000 votes in Arizona, with less than 50,000 votes left to count. Brnovich said that Democrats lost some races and Republicans won, and ""it came down to: people split their ticket. People voted for Republicans down-ballot, and they didn't vote for President Trump or [GOP Sen.] Martha McSally. So, that's the reality.""Brnovich said his office received 1,000 complaints about Sharpies being used on ballots, which is legal. People said the Sharpies ruined their ballots, but Brnovich said ""we looked into it. We were able to determine that did not affect anyone's vote. They also did a random audit of 2 percent of the precincts, and it came back 100 percent that there wasn't any statistical anomalies or errors.""Trump's re-election team filed a lawsuit claiming that votes cast in person were ""incorrectly rejected"" by poll workers, and a Maricopa County Superior Judge is set to review evidence in the case on Thursday. Brnovich said in this situation, ""we are literally talking about less than 200 votes that are in question. Even if was possible that those votes flip, those 200 votes, I do not think it will make a difference in Arizona, just because of the number.""

0,A family wage prioritizes conservative values and would solve coronavirus child care dilemmas,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/a-family-wage-prioritizes-conservative-values-and-would-solve-covid-19-child-care-dilemmas,"In this time of economic and social upheaval, many policy changes that would have been unthinkable are on the table. For a few examples, Republicans agreed to a massive direct stimulus payment, the Federal Reserve is enacting radical changes in policy, and unemployment benefits have been dramatically expanded. These responses offer an opportunity to shift economic policy in an even more family-centered direction. Many are already talking about the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns on families, with questions about the health and development of children and the reopening of schools a primary conversation piece. New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz said that New Yorkers are essentially being told to choose between their jobs and their children due to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s poor leadership. Hillary Clinton, in a tweet about a New York Times article, said, “We need to make child care more accessible and safe for every working parent.”With those comments in mind, a more important and timely question is: Why do so many households have two working parents in the first place? Isn’t it better if one parent is free to focus on raising children? A 2016 Pew poll found that 59% of adults believe that children with two parents are better off when a parent stays home. This view was held by the majority across all education levels and political affiliations in the survey. Given the apparent preference for a single-earning household, making child care more accessible is a bad idea. A massive increase in the availability of daycare increases the likelihood that both parents will work. Think about it this way: If daycare is more accessible, it will shift the economic incentives related to working rather than staying home with children, tilting the decision more in favor of working. The COVID-19 lockdowns have inconvenienced many parents, but national daycare isn’t the solution. A family wage is a proper solution. It would ensure that one parent could work outside the home while the other could stay home. This may appear to some to be a radical proposal, but back in 2004, a much more reactionary — and perhaps even ""conservative"" — Elizabeth Warren published a book decrying the “two income trap” that demonstrably hurts the economic prospects of middle-income families. In the book, Warren explains that a second income is largely used up paying other costs like babysitting and commuting that would otherwise not exist.How would a family wage work? Certainly not every line of work adds enough value to support a living wage for the employee. In much the same way that full-time employees often have more fringe benefits than part-time workers, a family wage could also be part of the basket of benefits for full-time work. Employers could be required to scale employees’ gross pay based on the number of dependents the employee listed on their W-2 forms. If implemented, a family wage structure would mean that if Susan were to stay home with the children, Bob would need to provide an income for the whole family. In addition to the benefits his employer provides such as health insurance and retirement contributions, Bob’s income would be based in part on the fact that he has four dependents: his three children and now his wife, Susan, who has chosen to spend her time caring for them.Assuming that Warren would support this type of policy, we can expect many Democrats to get on board. But what about Republicans? President Trump’s election in 2016 has emboldened those on the Right who are far more concerned about economic security and the health of the family than about budget issues and fighting unending wars abroad. It’s not hard to imagine Tucker Carlson agreeing with the notion of a family wage. The family wage is a policy that might build a coalition of America-first conservatives and liberal Democrats.The specifics of the policy would need to be hammered out, and we should be aware of potential unintended negative consequences, but the implementation of a family wage could improve our family lives immensely. As Oren Cass shows in his recent publication “The Cost of Thriving Index,” median wages today are far below median wages in the past in terms of the ability to secure basic needs. Basic housing, health insurance, transportation, and education are significantly more expensive relative to median wages today than they were as recently as the mid-1990s. A family wage could improve this ratio in favor of many families.It may seem radical, but this particular moment of upheaval and chaos can be used to foster a more family-first society. While economic policy is not a cure-all for social ills, implementing a family wage and turning economic policy toward the family is a move in the right direction.Levi Russell is an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Brandmeyer Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas and a Fellow at the Leonine Institute for Catholic Social Teaching.

Sign up here.The coronavirus was bad enough before we had reports of a mutant strain of the virus rampaging across the U.S., spreading faster and more aggressively than the original and making people more susceptible to repeat infections. So here’s some good news: those reports aren’t true.The reports were based on the findings of a study from scientists working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, who concluded in an unpublished paper that has yet to be peer-reviewed that a new strain of the virus had become dominant in the U.S. and Europe.But just as quickly as the hyperbolic reports spread across the internet this week, new research and a slew of coronavirus experts have come out to say that the conclusions drawn in the Los Alamos research cannot be backed up, and the world is still dealing with a single strain of the virus.Research published by scientists at the University of Glasgow shows that patients globally have been infected with a single strain of the new coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2. And while they have been mutations in that virus — thousands of them in fact — none of them is significant enough to cause a change in how the virus spreads or infects people.“Viruses, including the one causing COVID-19, naturally accumulate mutations – or changes – in their genetic sequence as they spread through populations,” the Glasgow researchers concluded. “However, most of these changes will have no effect on the virus biology or the aggressiveness of the disease they cause.”Following reports of multiple strains of the coronavirus being spread globally, the scientists in Glasgow undertook an extensive analysis of the virus genomes and found that the detected mutations are “unlikely to have any functional significance, and importantly, don’t represent different virus types.”As viruses spread and replicate in infected hosts, they typically generate mutations as they replicate. These mutations are normal for all viruses but do not represent a new strain of the virus.Just as with every other virus, new strains of the new coronavirus will emerge, but it would be very surprising to see such changes this early in the lifespan of SARS-CoV-2. Scientists only label something a new strain if the new version differs significantly from the original.The scientists in Glasgow have cataloged 7,237 mutations in the new coronavirus, and while that might sound like a lot, they say it is a relatively low rate of evolution for an RNA virus, and they expect more mutations will continue to accumulate as the pandemic continues.Other scientists have agreed: The Atlantic spoke to four world-renowned infectious disease experts who all said that all the evidence still pointed to a single strain of coronavirus.“The conclusions [from the Los Alamos study] are overblown,” Lisa Gralinski from the University of North Carolina, one of the few scientists in the world who specializes in coronaviruses, told he Atlantic. “To say that you’ve revealed the emergence of a more transmissible form of SARS-CoV-2 without ever actually testing it isn’t the type of thing that makes me feel comfortable as a scientist.”Listen and subscribe: Via Apple Podcasts | Via Spotify | Via Stitcher or anywhere else you get your podcasts.Cover: Medical staffs wear some protective apparatuses to treat patients at the new coronavirus ward of Kawasaki Municipal Tama Hospital in Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture on May 7, 2020, amid an outbreak of the new coronavirus COVID-19.

0,New coronavirus hospital in Madinah named after late Saudi nurse Nujood,https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/595287/SAUDI-ARABIA/New-coronavirus-hospital-in-Madinah-named-after-late-Saudi-nurse-Nujood,"
Saudi Gazette reportMADINAH â A newly built 100-bed integrated mobile hospital to treat coronavirus patients has been named after late Saudi female nurse Nujood Al-Khaibari in appreciation of her distinguished services. Nujood died recently after contracting the coronavirus infection while working in one of the hospitals in Madinah.Launched on Wednesday by Emir of Madinah Prince Faisal Bin Salman in the presence of Minister of Health Dr. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the Nujood Medical Center has been built in 59 days with the support of energy and desalinated water provider ACWA Power.Speaking on the occasion, Prince Faisal said: âIt is our utmost honor to serve the healthcare sector in Madinah. I would like to thank the Ministry of Health for the remarkable effort that was invested in this project. I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to ACWA Power, and the minister of energy for leading this initiative that leveraged the expertise of a pioneering company in the renewable energy sectorâ.For his part, the health minister said: âWe take immense pride today in serving the city of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) by adding 100 beds to King Fahadâs Hospital. This is undoubtedly a unique contribution by ACWA Power, led by the energy sector under the directives of Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman. The national energy sector played a prominent role in bolstering the efforts of the Ministry of Health during the pandemic through ACWA Powerâs contribution, a series of donations and supplying the equipment needed to tackle this pandemic.âDr. Al-Rabiah later tweeted, saying: âToday, the Governor of Madinah launched an integrated hospital with a capacity of 100 beds that was built in 59 days with the support of Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman and a donation from ACWA Power to provide better services.ââIt has been named the Nujood Medical Center after the late nurse Nujood Al-Khaibari, may God have mercy on her, in appreciation of what she did to serve patients and in gratitude for the efforts of health practitioners,â the health minister added.Nujoodâs sad demise caused an outpouring of national grief with Princess Reema Bint Bandar, Saudi Arabiaâs ambassador to the United States, joining scores of mourners in the Kingdom and outside in bidding a tearful adieu to the late nurse.âWe mourn Nujoodâs loss and remember her brave sacrifice; healthcare heroes are battling the global#Covid19 pandemic. Rest in peace #Nurse Nujood AlKhaibari,â Princess Reema had said in her tweet.Nujood, one of the brave health heroes, was working in the health sector of Madinah, died at the age of 45. She is survived by three daughters and a son. After graduating in nursing, Nujood worked tirelessly for 15 years, translating the spirit of dedication and commitment in all senses of the word in her profession.Nujood Medical Center is equipped with the latest medical gear and supplies needed to treat COVID-19 cases, including 40 ventilators, two intensive care units, a research laboratory, and medical gas pipeline systems that ensure a safe environment.The facility was developed based on the highest standards of quality and hosts some of the most advanced equipment that were hand-picked to ensure the durability of the hospital, which will be utilized as a part of the Ministry of Healthâs larger health facilities network after the pandemic comes to an end. The hospital was designed with stringent security and safety measures in mind for its patients as well as medical and administrative staff and the surrounding areas.Mohammad Abunayyan, chairman ACWA Power, expressed his gratitude and appreciation to Prince Abdulaziz for directing and enabling the contribution of the private sector, which is aimed at mitigating the repercussions of the pandemic."
0,Make-A-Wish Foundation finds creative solutions to grant wishes during coronavirus,https://www.inforum.com/community/nonprofits/6595708-Make-A-Wish-Foundation-finds-creative-solutions-to-grant-wishes-during-coronavirus,"FARGO — As approximately 60 North Dakotan kids await their ""wishes"" to be granted by the well-known nonprofit organization, staff navigated their new normal during the coronavirus. ""Kids are still being diagnosed with a condition that could qualify them for our program. So we want to be there, you know. Hope is really essential since a lot of our kids have compromised immune systems,"" said Billi Zielinski, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish North Dakota.The foundation grants the wish of a child diagnosed with a critical illness in the United States and its territories, on average, every 33 minutes. For new ""wish kids"", travel will be a difficult wish to grant during the pandemic.""We are really trying to get at those questions of why and how and what does that look like. And does it always have to look the same as this is Disney,"" Zielinski said.But for three wish kids, Make-A-Wish staff were able to make their dreams come true this summer. ""They really went above and beyond our expectations. I didn't think it would be as cool as it was,"" said Hannah DeGroat, mom to 7-year-old Dexter. Last year, Dexter and his mom moved to Fargo from Minot so Dexter could receive treatment for a brain tumor. For Dexter, his wish was simple: to be an ""army man"".During June, Dexter rode in a tank, extinguished a fire, and tried a helicopter simulator.More than 5,000 kids throughout the U.S. are still waiting for thier wish to granted , and Zielinski said that number will grow.To help the families wait, Make-A-Wish constantly communicates, raises money for future wishes, and sends notes from the community.They say many families have been in isolation, including Dexter's. He wasn't in school during treatment and left again because of the pandemic. He misses it.""That's all I want to do right now,"" he said.Hanah said, the wish was a welcome break from quarantine.""It was a really welcome break from all of the monotony of the whole self-isolating and whatnot,"" she said.But for Hanah and many other families, one thing is more important than a wish. ""You know, Dexter is really healthy right now, and strong. He is making improvement every day,"" she said."
0,Interns Seek Solutions to Isolation During the Summer of Coronavirus,https://www.wsj.com/articles/interns-seek-solutions-to-isolation-during-the-summer-of-coronavirus-11594598400,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/interns-seek-solutions-to-isolation-during-the-summer-of-coronavirus-11594598400Katie Garceran was playing a game of virtual Pictionary with other interns in the Washington, D.C.-based Fund for American Studies internship program from her apartment in Boone, N.C. Suddenly the game screen went black for five minutes.The energy was weird at first as everyone waited for the coordinator to fix the issue. After they scrapped the game for the night, what started as a silent guessing game of who would unmute themselves first ended as an opportunity for everyone to share details about their internship experiences so far. It was a moment that made the 21-year-old Ms. Garceran feel less alone. “It’s a little bit awkward, kind of tentative at first. But it’s exciting once people start talking and try to get to know each other,” Ms. Garceran says.Halfway through this most virtual summer, one thing’s certain: Many interns crave a greater sense of unity to help them feel like they’re not in this alone. Managers report that interns are requesting additional communication and events that allow them to get to know each other informally. Those running virtual summer internships that are now halfway over are still figuring out how to make the interns feel less isolated.As employers shift to remote work, about 53% of students said they were most concerned about feelings of solitude on the job, according to market research firm Propeller Insights, which surveyed 1,003 college students on behalf of college career site Handshake in late June.At






            Ford Motor Co.


      , more than 600 interns spent the past few weeks participating in activities meant to help them forge relationships. During one session, some spent half an hour socializing and the other half testing their Ford knowledge in hopes of scoring a mystery prize. Intern Kristina Nunez, who logs on from home in Ann Arbor, Mich., enjoys using this time to learn about what the other interns have in common. She wishes the company would set up more events like this.“There’s been a lot of opportunities to talk to full-time employees or recent college graduates and hear their take on the company or what they’re doing, but my team doesn’t immediately have another intern, so I can’t really bounce ideas off of them or hear what they’re doing,” says Ms. Nunez, 22.Ford U.S. talent acquisition and onboarding lead Lena Allison has gotten this feedback a lot in recent weeks. The company has planned more events that bring interns together to hang out, such as small groups where interns can use gift cards from the company to buy sundaes and get to know each other. At






            Amazon,


      which has more than 8,000 interns this year, interns knew about virtual events and networking opportunities, but were most interested in communicating with each other and their teams, Brett Saks, director of student programs at Amazon, says. The solution interns wanted didn’t involve any complicated technology, Mr. Saks says. It was as simple as having coordinators help them set up chat rooms for an intern class that large.It’s important to reassess how often people are communicating and what kind of technology is most efficient, says David Caffo, executive vice president of Cooperative Education & Internship Association. That could mean making a monthly intern social event happen weekly instead, or having check-ins with managers happen via phone call instead of instant message. In some cases, uncertainty surrounding proper communication protocols and structure has caused some new employees to feel anxious. Making those structures as explicit as possible is key, says Priti Khare, a spokeswoman at Handshake.Anna Blair Poulson, 21, interns remotely for 25 hours a week at Washington Life, a luxury lifestyle publication in Washington, D.C. The free rein she has over her hours gives her the flexibility to work from 9 to 5, or whenever inspiration strikes, so long as she gets her work done on time. Given a choice, how much would you prefer to work from home? Join the conversation below.But even though she fights the temptation to sleep in, emails her mentor constantly and keeps a running to-do list to stay focused, sometimes she’s unsure when she should be near her email and when it’s OK to step away. “It’s very important for me to stay on top of my emails and my to-do list to make sure I’m not dropping the ball on anything, since I don’t have a supervisor walking by my desk and asking for progress updates,” she says.Microsoft intern Olaseni Adeniji looked forward to soaking up the company’s culture and joining his colleagues on Intern Day, an annual event that rewards interns with swag, food and surprise music performances. Pitbull, Ella Mai and Julia Michaels have performed there in recent years. Instead, the 21-year-old’s dreams of the Redmond, Wash., campus were replaced with the house he shares with his brother’s family in Laurel, Md.Mr. Adeniji says he appreciates the company’s efforts this summer. Still, he says, “Regardless of how good everything is, it’s really not going to be like that physical experience, you know?” The sense of how well you’re doing that comes from employers seeing your hard work firsthand gets lost while doing remote work, says Dan Cable, a professor at London Business School whose research focuses on employee engagement and organizational culture. Employees may feel pressure to show their commitment in other ways, even if it means spending extra hours at the computer in an effort to produce impressive work since the employer can’t look over their shoulder so often.Mr. Adeniji says he sometimes loses track of how many hours he sits at his computer checking emails from senior employees before he pulls himself away so as not to burn himself out.It’s incumbent on employers to make sure interns don’t feel like they’re on call and expected to work beyond their allotted number of hours, Ms. Khare says.“Make sure you make your expectations explicit, so that you’re not experiencing burnout and your new employees aren’t overwhelmed,” she says.1) Consider how often you have activities and events. If get-togethers only happen once a month, it’s likely that interns still won’t know each other well. Finding a more consistent rhythm could make it easier to get past the awkward phase and more into fun.2) Form small groups or teams. While large groups can be overwhelming at times, smaller groups can make virtual calls easier and allow deeper discussions where everyone has more time to talk and feel included. Group projects can also give interns a chance to work with and learn from each other.3) Encourage one-on-one check-ins among interns. It’s important to network with employees in the company. That should include other interns.4) Create chat rooms where interns can get to know each other. Not every meeting point has to be via video call. It can be helpful to know others are around during the day, ready to offer on-the-spot advice or share informal thoughts in casual conversation. 5) Make communication and scheduling protocols clear. If interns have flexibility to make their own hours, be specific on expectations so that they aren’t on standby or working overtime to meet them.

0,Israel shuts down on weekends. Denmark moved school outside. Could Ohio try unique solutions to curb coronavirus as cases rise?,https://www.cleveland.com/coronavirus/2020/07/israel-shuts-down-on-weekends-denmark-moved-school-outside-could-ohio-try-unique-solutions-to-curb-coronavirus-as-cases-rise.html,"Israeli protesters wear swimsuits to against the planned closing of the beaches during a protest in front of the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem, Friday, July 17, 2020. Israel announced sweeping new restrictions on Friday in response to a new surge in coronavirus cases, including weekend closures of many businesses and limiting restaurants to takeout and delivery. (AP Photo/Sebastian Scheiner)APCLEVELAND, Ohio – Israel is trying to limit the spread of the coronavirus by closing non-essential businesses and tourist spots on weekends.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the new restrictions, which includes closing beaches and restaurant dining, as an attempt to avoid a more general lockdown like the one the country imposed during the early days of the crisis. And they represent the latest unique approach to the pandemic.U.S. states and other countries are testing lots of ideas, from moving school outside to allowing alcohol at restaurants only when diners eat meals.Critics wonder how effective Israel’s half-measure could be. While shopping areas and tourist spots may be less crowded during the week, the virus could still spread Monday through Friday, University Hospitals infectious disease specialist Dr. Amy Edwards said.“I think it’s a compromise on the economic side,” Edwards said. “When it comes to public health, it doesn’t really matter what day of the week it is.”The head of the Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians is also skeptical of the strategy, telling The Times of Israel that it “doesn’t make any logical sense” because people could just gather in private homes on weekends.The trajectory of the pandemic in Israel is similar to Ohio, which is also seeing an increase in cases over the last few weeks. Gov. Mike DeWine has urged Ohio residents to take precautions to limit the spread of infections, but has taken a more hands-off approach compared to the decisive actions that earned him national recognition in the early days of the pandemic.The situation in Ohio is not as dire as Israel, a country of 8.6 million people that reported more than 1,800 new coronavirus infections on Thursday. But Ohio, which has a population of 11.7 million, reported its highest single-day total of 1,679 new cases on Friday, and nearly 60 percent of Ohio residents live in counties where the risk of transmission is high enough that they’re required to wear a face mask.Public health experts say the best approach to limiting the spread of the coronavirus is a combination of social-distancing, the use of face masks, good hand hygiene, robust testing and contact tracing. Countries that have been particularly effective in implementing those strategies, such as South Korea and New Zealand, have largely contained the spread of the virus.Here are some of the other strategies that have been tried in the United States and internationally.DenmarkIn Denmark, schools limited the size of their classes and moved much of the school day outdoors, where public health expert say the risk of transmission is lower. The strategy -- which began in April -- worked; the country did not see a rise in cases linked to its schools, according to The Guardian.Edwards complimented Denmark’s approach, but noted it would be difficult to replicate in Ohio. Denmark allocated more money to its schools so they could make changes and hire more teachers, but DeWine announced $300 million in cuts to cuts to K-12 public-school funding in order to balance the state budget.And while “Great British Baking Show”-style tents sound great, holding classes outside becomes impossible once the weather turns colder.“That’s not going to be feasible throughout the calendar, when it’s cold and snowing outside,” Edwards said.United KingdomThe U.K. is among a host of countries that have used drones to enforce coronavirus lockdowns. Law enforcement in the English city of Derbyshire defended their use of drones to “shame” people into not traveling into a national park, according to The Guardian.France, the Netherlands, China and India have all used drones to monitor crowds and issue social-distancing orders. Several U.S. states have also used them to monitor public spaces; the city of Fairfield in southwest Connecticut used them at beaches and parks.However, critics say using drones to monitor crowds is an invasion of privacy. A Paris court suspended the use of drones until civil liberties questions could be addressed.The NetherlandsScientists at the KWR Water Research Institute found the virus that causes COVID-19 in a local sewage system in February, three weeks before the Netherlands confirmed its first infection. Detecting a high number of COVID-19 particles in wastewater could give officials some time to warn the public and corral supplies in an area expected to see a spike in hospitalizations caused by the coronavirus, public health experts say.State and federal officials have launched a pilot program in Ohio to test wastewater in Cincinnati and Marion. Officials told cleveland.com the program could expand statewide, but an EPA spokeswoman could not immediately provide an update Friday afternoon.South KoreaSouth Korea required international travelers into its capital, Seoul, to download a cellphone app and self-report any symptoms every day. The app tracks a person’s movements, and sends alerts to other nearby users, according to Foreign Affairs.But like drones, the use of cellphone apps to track people raises civil liberties concerns, especially because many tech companies scrambled to create the tracking software as quickly as possible, according to The New York Times.CanadaCanada’s four maritime provinces are taking a regional approach to travel restrictions. Anyone living in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island can travel freely among the four. But each province has its own rules for other travelers.Manitoba is the only other province with domestic travel restrictions; officials have lifted them in Quebec, Ontario and elsewhere.Travel restrictions could limit the spread of the virus, but only if they’re guided by science, Edwards said. If cases exploded in New Brunswick, for example, it would not make sense to allow free travel to the other maritime provinces.“What you don’t want to do is allow places with high transmission to travel to places with low transmission,” Edwards said. “That’s what you want to avoid.”PennsylvaniaOhio’s eastern neighbor is also seeing a recent increase in cases, and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has responded by issuing a statewide face-mask mandate. He’s also encouraging businesses to transition to a work-from-home model whenever possible.Pennsylvania is also rolling back some of its efforts to reopen its economy. The state is reducing indoor dining to just 25 percent of a restaurant’s capacity, and only diners having meals can consume alcohol on-premise.Edwards said reducing dining capacity could be a worthwhile strategy, but restaurants must ensure tables are kept 6 feet apart for social distancing.“The whole point of this is to limit the number of people you come into contact with, and particularly close and prolonged contact,” Edwards said.IndianaLike Ohio, Indiana has yet to issue a statewide face-mask mandate. But Gov. Eric Holcomb responded to a recent uptick in coronavirus infections by hitting the pause button on the state’s efforts to reopen its economy.The state will remain in Stage 4.5 of reopening plan for at least two more weeks, Holcomb said this week. The final stage of the plan, Stage 5, allows most businesses to operate at full capacity and government offices to re-open to the public.MassachusettsAs the debate over whether to re-open schools in the fall rages across the U.S., Massachusetts teachers are proposing the same type of phased approach that most states used to re-open their economies. The state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education previously released guidelines asking school districts to prepare three plans: one for in-person classes, another for online classes and a third for a hybrid approach.The state teachers union countered by releasing a four-part plan. It begins with an initial period of setting up classrooms and learning health guidelines. That’s followed by meetings with students and their families, either in-person or virtually. The third phase would involve a six-week period of lessons in-person, virtually or a hybrid model. The final phase is an assessment period.Cleveland.com reporter Robin Goist contributed to this story.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our   User Agreement,  Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,  and Your California Privacy Rights  (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.

0,$280K in grants go to MI companies creating coronavirus solutions,https://www.woodtv.com/health/coronavirus/280k-in-grants-go-to-mi-companies-creating-coronavirus-solutions/,"WOODTV.comby: Heather WalkerGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A new set of grants aims to move Michigan forward during the coronavirus pandemic, sending cash to airports, ambulances and everything in between.PlanetM, the state of Michigan’s mobility initiative, awarded more than $280,000 to five companies to combat challenges caused by the virus.One of the recipients is GHSP in Grand Haven, which created a UV-C light that can kill the virus in five minutes.“It’s been awesome,” said Cathy Stewart, an engineer with the company. “When we first plugged them all in and we are taking the readings and how quickly the germs are being removed is very exciting.”The lights are being tested now in ambulances out of Grand Haven and next in Grand Rapids. Ridesharing services like UBER and Lyft could be next to install the lights.“It’s endless. Wherever you feel the UV-C can go into, you can put it there,” Stewart said.At Gerald R. Ford International Airport near Grand Rapids, disinfecting robots will soon be roaming around. Pratt Miller, based near Farmington Hills, created them to dispense a federally-approved disinfectant through a multihead sprayer. They use sensors and data to guarantee coverage.A company out of Troy, Penske Vehicle Services, is creating safety partitions for vehicles to create a physical buffer between drivers and passengers. RCO Engineering is also developing pilot partitions.A California-based company, Gatik created an autonomous delivery truck. Fixed routes in Grand Rapids and Rochester will start soon, working to keep supply chains moving with contactless delivery.The solutions will start being implemented next month.Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

0,African solutions to the coronavirus crisis,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52776994,"By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC NewsThe African continent hasn't been as badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic as other countries in the world so far, but new cases are on the rise and governments have introduced social distancing measures.And while the pandemic is bad for business, some African entrepreneurs have stepped up to be part of the solution and are seeing new opportunities. Frequent and thorough washing of hands with soap and warm water is one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. But according to Water Aid, four in 10 people around the world have no access to basic hand washing facilities. One of the ways in which the coronavirus is spread is via contaminated surfaces. Getting into the habit of regular hand washing can prevent infections, but the virus can still spread as people tend to touch the tap and other things around them.In a city like Freetown in Sierra Leone, a population of 2 million people has a water supply capacity which ideally should be used by no more than 800,000 people, according to international development consultancy firm IMC Worldwide. Water is already scarce, and now hand washing is crucial.To solve this problem, one business has developed a portable hands-free tap unit that is now being placed outside shops, banks and government buildings.The Fomel Industry and National Industrialization Centre (FINIC) usually specialises in manufacturing agriculture processing equipment and other machines.But now the firm, founded by Melvin Foday Kamara, is manufacturing a portable freestanding hands-free faucet that is operated by stepping on pedals to access soap and water on demand.Clean running water is also in short supply in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, where citizens told the BBC they are now washing their hands with washing up liquid, as they cannot afford to buy hand sanitiser.""In the area where I live, running water is very scarce, so we actually have to have buckets of water so that it's easy for us to wash our hands,"" Wadzanayi Musasa explains.""When we get home from the shops, we take off our gloves, we use dish washing liquid to wash our hands and someone will hold a jug of water [to rinse them].""Waste management and clean water provider Clean City is now distributing water around Harare's residential and commercial areas in tank trucks, so that citizens can collect extra buckets of water to ensure hygiene standards are preserved through the lockdown.The company started in 2018, in response to two cholera epidemics that hit Zimbabwe in 2008 and 2018. The firm says it realised that something had to be done to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Compared to people living in richer nations, people in developing countries are more negatively impacted by waste that isn't managed properly, which puts both human health and the environment at risk.More than 90% of waste in developing nations goes to dumpsites, according to data from the United Nations Environment Programme.Every day, Clean City also offers fumigation and decontamination services across Harare, which can be ordered using a mobile app.""We're basically driven by two principles - digital first and people first,"" says Clean City's chief executive Lovemore Nyatsine.""Everything is contactless. Our crews follow very clear processes to keep our clients and themselves safe.""One example of an industry stepping up as a result of the pandemic is the 3D printing community - tech firms, universities and 3D print enthusiasts with their own printers are responding to the shortage of healthcare workers' personal protective equipment (PPE) - and in some cases more complex hospital medical supplies - by making it themselves. Malawi has been experiencing severe shortages of PPE during the coronavirus lockdown.The shortages are due to costs of procuring the equipment, as well as disruption caused by the pandemic to global supply chains. Blantyre-based tech firm iMoSyS is one such company that is now using its 3D printers and computer assisted design (CAD) software to design reusable face masks and face shields for healthcare workers.Typically the firm focuses on providing IT and engineering services to enable the remote monitoring of industrial processes, infrastructure and patients' health.Entrepreneur Mayamiko Nkoloma, chief executive of iMoSyS, says his firm has received numerous requests from across the African continent, but also from overseas countries including the UK.""Anything is possible. We started with nothing but ideas, and we took our ideas to industries and pitched them to solve challenges,"" he tells the BBC.Despite the myriad challenges presented by the pandemic, to say nothing of the looming recession once lockdown measures are eventually lifted, some firms feel trying times are when real growth and change is possible.""As bad as the coronavirus is, it has provided the opportunity for many leaders in business and in governance to have a rethink,"" says Mr Karama of Finic in Sierra Leone. ""It is important that we leverage innovation...it is important that Africa learns to innovate, to monetise [and] not to import everything.""

0,Adaptive Reuse Growing In Importance As More Buildings Need To Change For The Coronavirus Era,https://www.bisnow.com/chicago/news/construction-development/adaptive-reuse-growing-in-importance-as-more-buildings-need-to-change-for-the-covid-19-era-105296,"The coronavirus pandemic is changing commercial real estate in unpredictable ways. Some landlords will need to find new uses for buildings where demand is drying up as more tenants decide to keep workforces at home, and most buildings will need retrofits to improve protections for tenants that do return.Legal cannabis cultivation and sales are also spreading to many new jurisdictions, boosting demand for developers and architects that can repurpose old industrial structures and retail outlets for this new industry.Tenants were already flocking to revamped historic structures such as Chicago's Main Post Office, but to take advantage of the growing demand for such projects, developers need to rethink how they have approached building renovations, especially the installation of new HVAC systems, a key consideration in the coronavirus era.Viruses are much smaller than bacteria, so something more is needed than traditional HVAC systems, which can filter out bacteria, Sterling Bay Director of Life Sciences Catherine Vorwald said during Bisnow’s Chicago Deep Dish: Repositioning & Renovation webinar July 16.Vorwald, who was scientifically trained at the National Institutes of Health before joining the commercial real estate industry, said Sterling Bay is looking into using HVAC systems that chemically treat air with hydrogen peroxide, which would kill viruses before they circulate within buildings.“Spoken like a true scientist,” said moderator Ira Singer, principal at Northbrook, Illinois-based Mosaic Construction, which specializes in multifamily and has also constructed dozens of cannabis shops nationwide.Novel Coworking CEO Bill Bennett said attention to such details and a willingness to try new approaches will be important qualities for anyone renovating a structure.“There really is no one solution for air quality,” he said.Novel Coworking has stayed open as an essential business throughout the pandemic, which taught it valuable lessons about redesigning buildings so tenants will feel safe, including making HVAC upgrades, instituting plans for more spacing between workers, restricting elevator usage, adding handwashing stations and changing the flow of people around an office to reduce face-to-face interactions.“It’s the 1,000 things you’re going to do, it’s not one silver bullet,” Bennett said.Singer added that new renovations, whatever the type of building, are now about more than simple alterations to the built environment. It’s also about keeping an eye on how users’ behavior within structures needs to change.That’s a challenge, Bennett said, but having to understand clients’ operations and not just how much and what type of space they need also provides builders with opportunities to create closer relationships.“Everybody I know hates their landlord, but people love their business partners, and they love having a partner who looks at their business and finds ways to help their business succeed.”“What you’re really describing is a design-build philosophy where we’re understanding the vision that the client has for the building, bringing good design, along with construction, and constructability thinking, to understand budgeting,” Singer said.That strategy is key to Mosaic’s cannabis work, he added.“We are taking large-scale industrial warehouse buildings and essentially repurposing them and building a shell of a building inside an existing building for our clients to grow and harvest cannabis. It’s unbelievable to take a blight of a 70K to 80K SF building that is sitting there doing nothing, repurpose it and bring it to life.”Confirmed!

Workday and IBM have announced an expanded partnership and a new joint solution to help enterprise players in their return to the office. In order to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, a number of governments and other authorities worldwide quickly imposed lockdowns which forced businesses and offices to close. This, in turn, forced a transition for many of us to working from home, and while some may remain remote for the foreseeable future, others will be asked to return to the office.  How to do so safely is a matter of importance and it is the responsibility of business and community leaders to make sure everything possible is done to reduce the risk of causing a COVID-19 outbreak.  See also: IBM intros new security dashboard for its financial services cloud Blanket legislation can only go so far when it comes to preparing businesses to return to the office on the ground. Social distancing markers, the availability of sanitizer, and PPE guidance can help, as well as working out the maximum number of people allowed in the workplace at one time.  However, this may not be enough to face the challenge. As a result, IBM and Workday's new solution aims to help ""business and community leaders plan, schedule, and monitor a safe return to the workplace for employees."" The new solution combines a range of Workday and IBM management systems already offered to the enterprise. IBM and Workday say this will merge ""planning capabilities with critical employee, community health, and workplace data.""At the heart of the joint effort is Workday Adaptive Planning, a flexible solution already in use by over 5,000 enterprises for planning, forecasts, and modeling. In light of COVID-19, the software now includes Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) and the input of data concerning worker readiness to return to the office.  While this solution is enough for managing employee numbers in a safe way and can be used to organize split shift systems, for example, IBM Watson Works has now also been integrated.  CNET: Now What: How work-from-home is evolving IBM says that businesses need the ""right data and insights"" to bring employees back to the workplace safely in a COVID-19 world, and so IBM Watson Works has been created to give clients these insights -- with the help of  Watson artificial intelligence (AI) models.  IBM Watson Works is a set of products leveraging Watson's AI for facility management, workplace re-entry, care management, workplace safety, and contact tracing.  TechRepublic: How companies are getting employees to take vacation this summer rather than hoard PTO Data analyzed by the system can provide ""evidence-based"" predictions and information for users to manage COVID-19 challenges, as well as decide what new protocols are suitable for their businesses.  These can include: ""Keeping employees safe during the return to workplace process is of critical importance to business leaders across industries,"" said Kareem Yusuf, general manager of AI Applications, IBM Cloud and Cognitive Software. ""By partnering with Workday on a joint solution, we're extending the capabilities delivered by Watson Works to help customers gain greater agility to respond to ever-changing working conditions and evolving business needs.""

Ready to restart: Not just start-ups, even legacy businesses are

Ready to restart: Not just start-ups, even legacy businesses are
   -  Getty Images/iStockphoto
This week was a fairly active one as far as activities went. With the rains finally setting in for some sustained activity in Delhi, I bought myself — after trying out several — some good old Bata slippers with a strong, non-slip sole. I also had a much-delayed haircut and had my wildly sprouting beard finally trimmed. I consulted a doctor about tweaking my medication for hypertension. And I finally managed to fulfil my craving for momos, which I had not had since the first lockdown began in March, as well as for mava cake, a speciality of old-school Irani bakeries. And, also shopped for some fresh groceries. A fairly humdrum set of activities you might think — and you would be right. Except for one significant difference — I did all of this without stepping outside of my gated community.The chappals were bought from a Bata mobile store, which set up shop in my colony over the weekend. They didn’t bring mountains of stock, but what they had was sensible and suited for the season — rubber and synthetic footwear, sports shoes and no-nonsense ‘home’ footwear for women. And some clever marketing, like pitching their washable footwear as ones where you can “wash away the virus”.My haircut, beard trim and massage were performed by a young lad from Urban Company, who brought his entire salon with him in a bag, including single-use capes, gloves and masks for him and me, his own sanitiser and even a garbage bag to take the sweepings away. After five months of avoidance, a haircut felt marvellous, with the added comfort of overseeing the sanitisation process oneself in the safety of one’s own home.Ditto for the momos, which were of the frozen, ready-to-cook variety. Only, they were ordered and delivered through a food delivery app which I had hitherto used only to order prepared food from restaurants. The cake came from a bakery, which had tied up with a delivery service, and the groceries from a speciality food store. And the doctor’s appointment was also virtual, fixed and executed over my mobile phone.The Covid-19 pandemic sweeping the country has wreaked havoc with the economy. As the country reeled from one lockdown to another, and later, as cities struggled to cope with unlocking and resultant case load spikes, businesses across the spectrum — from tiny ones like neighbourhood barbershops to giant manufacturing enterprises like automobile factories and airlines — faced unprecedented disruption in business as usual. The lockdown decimated brick-and-mortar retail, destroyed the travel and hospitality sector and derailed services businesses as public transport went off the road.But those which managed to pivot quickly may actually be the front-runners in the post-Covid world. The IT sector, for instance, was one of the first to move, migrating millions of knowledge workers to “work from home”, while maintaining enterprise level security protocols.The shoes store coming to my colony is an equally interesting pivot. Footwear and apparel, which is quite dependent on the physical “touch and try” experience (despite the inroads made by e-commerce) were hit — particularly in metros — by the closure of malls and retail spaces. By taking the store to the customer, they are managing to reconnect with customers, generate fresh business, and more importantly, keep their franchisees alive.Ditto for the food delivery apps. As the restaurants which generated the bulk of their business shut down, they quickly shifted to leverage their core skill of delivery to handle everything from groceries to consumer non-durables to medicines. My “at home” haircut actually exemplifies the new normal: the “work from anywhere” approach. If the mountain cannot come to Mohammad, Mohammad must go to the mountain — if your customers cannot come to you, businesses must go to their customers.In fact, a new study released this week by PwC — titled ‘Full Potential Revival and Growth- Charting India’s medium-term journey’ — has found that the pandemic impact has triggered some unexpected convergences and synergies: the pharma sector using FMCG distribution chains for masks, PPEs and sanitisers; or the government leveraging data from financial sector players to target assistance to MSMEs; or a delivery service partnering with FMCGs to restock stores.The PwC report suggests that “Organisations should look at two types of action — one related to volume of economic activity, which can be achieved by deepening, widening and heightening the organisation, and the other related to improvements in productivity by formalising and digitalising.”It advocates corporates to look at “a decentralised structure that is able to deal with local situations, rather than a centralised implementation structure”.While all this sounds quite encouraging, one must bear in mind that the economy is far from having recovered from the shattering effect of the pandemic. We are — now that the first uptick of pent-up demand has been met post easing of restrictions — now entering our first major recession since 1979. Arguably almost every Indian household — except for the tiny fraction at the very top of the pyramid — has experienced some form of income destruction or job loss.This is going to profoundly alter consumer behaviour, when it comes to both savings and investments. Leveraging technology and big data, walking the extra mile to the customer’s door, even changing the way you work — all of this can only help to some extent. Unless the consumer gets back confidence in the economy and her future prospects, spending behaviour is likely to stay constrained. Even those businesses which have managed to react quickly — apart from those sectors which directly benefited from the pandemic like healthcare and pharma — are back to at best 30-40 per cent of the pre-Covid “normal”. It may be years before growth revives to pre-Covid averages, if at all.Can this be changed? Can we make a faster comeback? PwC researchers believe it can, if we adopt what they call a “whole-of-society” approach — where corporates, citizens and government actively collaborate to reinvent the future.In my view, that is too ambitious an ask. As a society and as a people, we are more a nation of individual innovators rather than team players. Japanese ideas like kaizen and quality circles have been assiduously encouraged in India for decades but have had nothing like the kind of impact they have had in other Asian economies. We are simply not wired that way.Instead, I have greater faith in our ability as a collective to innovate on the fly and to adapt very quickly to changed circumstances. It is not just the agile, digitally-driven start-ups that are pivoting and innovating. Even legacy businesses are showing that they can change. Above all, people have shown an astonishing capacity to adapt. Indian IT may have shifted six million workers to work from home, but ordinary schools and teachers have managed to shift many times that number to online and virtual learning. It is this which gives one greater confidence that we can, eventually, overcome.You have reached your weekly free article limit.To get full access, please subscribe.  Already have an account ?

0,Hawaiiâ€™s records 3 coronavirus-related deaths; new infections include Kona hospital worker,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/07/13/breaking-news/3-more-hawaii-residents-with-coronavirus-die-bringing-statewide-death-toll-to-22/,"COURTESY GOV. DAVID IGE / FACEBOOKCINDY ELLEN RUSSELL / June 15State health director Bruce Anderson announced three more deaths of Hawaii residents with COVID-19 today.UPDATE: 6:05 p.m.An employee at Kona Community Hospital has tested positive for coronavirus, Hawaii County officials said today.The employee tested positive on Friday.“The hospital is in the process of contact tracing to identify anyone that may have been in contact with the staff member. No additional employees have been tested positive,” county officials said. They said the state Department of Health “is supporting the hospital’s care and management of the affected employee and precautions to protect patients and staff.”>> RELATED STORY: Gov. Ige extends start date of pre-travel testing of trans-Pacific arrivals until Sept. 1Earlier today, state officials announced that three more Hawaii residents with coronavirus have died, bringing the statewide COVID-19 death toll to 22 since the outbreak began in Hawaii in late February.PREVIOUS COVERAGEThere were three more coronavirus-related deaths reported today involving Hawaii residents, a “tragic reminder of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and their families.”State health officials said an elderly Kauai resident died in Arizona, while receiving treatment for several months for underlying medical conditions. Another female, a previous resident of a care home, died in an Oahu hospital Sunday morning, and an elderly Oahu man with underlying medical issues was also added to the death toll after reviewing his health history.The latest fatalities raise Hawaii’s coronavirus-related death toll to 22. Fifteen of the deaths have been on Oahu, six on Maui and one resident outside of the state.“We all extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family and friends of these three people. The best tribute to their lives and to the lives of all 22 people who’ve lost the fight against coronavirus, is getting everyone in Hawaii to take personal responsibility for their own health and the health of everyone around them,” Health Director Dr. Bruce Anderson said in a news release.Along with the deaths, the state also reported 23 new COVID-19 cases today, including 19 on Oahu, one each on Hawaii island and Maui, and two diagnosed outside the state, bringing the statewide total to 1,243 since Feb. 28.The new cases include a Nuuanu YMCA employee and their household member, also a member of the facility. The cases are not related to a cluster involving two gyms, YMCA president and CEO Michael Broderick said in a statement. The DOH has determined that the COVID-19-positive individuals were not in close contact with other YMCA members and program participants who were notified of the cases today.As of today, 310 infections in Hawaii are active cases, with a total of 911 patients now classified by health officials as “released from isolation.” The category counts those infected people who have met the criteria for being released from isolation. Twenty-one new release cases — 18 on Oahu, two on Hawaii island and one on Maui — were reported today.Today’s statewide coronavirus case total includes 942 on Oahu, 135 in Maui County, 102 on Hawaii island, and 43 in Kauai County, according to health officials. The total also includes 21 Hawaii residents diagnosed outside of the state.The state’s highest single-day number of reported cases — 42 — was reported on Saturday and cases continue to climb.>> RELATED: Many maskless people enjoy ‘Open Street Kalakaua’ in Waikiki while coronavirus continues to spreadMost of the 86 cases recorded since last Friday were linked to previous “community spread” clusters, including 44 cases from a training activity at Hawaiian Airlines, in which “a person infected during these meetings is linked to a cluster of 20 cases involving two Oahu gyms.” The gyms have not been disclosed.“This clearly shows how easily and quickly this virus can spread from person-to-person and from place-to-place when people are not practicing physical distancing, not wearing masks, not staying home when sick, and possibly not washing their hands frequently and thoroughly,” state Epidemiologist Sarah Park said in the news release.Health officials are urging the public to remain vigilant to break the disease chain — wear masks and stay 6 feet away from others while outside the home, and do not gather outside household bubbles.Other clusters reported are a result of pau hana gatherings, businesses, urgent care and long-term care facilities, and birthday parties, Father’s Day and 4th of July celebrations and religious events.“While the majority of Hawaii’s residents are using safe practices, clearly there are some who are not, and frankly unless everyone pays attention, we’ll, unfortunately, continue to see illnesses and deaths associated with COVID-19,” Anderson said. “Personal responsibility is the way we’ll again flatten the curve and retain Hawaii’s leadership through this unprecedented public health crisis. The upward trend of cases not only impacts people’s health but will likely delay our state’s economic recovery.”Of all the confirmed Hawaii cases since the start of the outbreak, 128 have required hospitalizations, with three new hospitalizations reported today, health officials said.Two hospitalizations in the statewide count are Hawaii residents who were diagnosed and treated outside the state. Of the 126 hospitalizations within the state, 97 have been on Oahu, 25 on Maui, three on Hawaii island, and one on Kauai.By county, Honolulu has seen 660 patients released from isolation, and Maui has had 120 patients released. Hawaii County officials say the Big Island has eight active infections, while Kauai County has five.Of the 96,079 coronavirus tests conducted so far by state and clinical laboratories in Hawaii, just over 1.3% have been positive. Health officials counted 3,836 new test results in today’s tally.Click here to see our full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.

0,Bringing college students back to Boston feels dangerous. I’ll be teaching them in person anyway.,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/15/opinion/bringing-college-students-back-boston-feels-dangerous-ill-be-teaching-them-person-anyway/,"In 1890, my great-grandfather built a one-room schoolhouse on his eastern Washington homestead. His son became a school principal, and his son, my dad, a professor of education at the Ohio State University. Education is something of the family business for my people, like farming or mining, but with less of a chance to appear in a multi-generational beer ad.I did my best to avoid this patrimony, but about 10 years ago I accepted a position teaching journalism at Northeastern University. I have yet to regret the decision; my students have been, almost without exception, conscientious, idealistic, and ambitious. They are a sure antidote to any pessimism one might feel about the future of our country, and I often say I would fight a war for them.AdvertisementIt feels like I might have to this fall.Boston is the site of one of the world’s great mass migrations, as something north of 200,000 students descend on the metro area every September. To put this in perspective, that’s more than twice the number of people who deluged California during the gold rush of 1849. We don’t have as many university students as New York or Los Angeles, but we have the largest proportion of students of any large American city.In most years, the influx of students is both an engine of the local economy and a source of creativity and innovation. This year it’s more likely to be a source of infection. This weekend was the deadline for Northeastern faculty to apply to teach remotely. I won’t lie: It crossed my mind. I’m asthmatic and have a mild arrhythmia. I could make a case. But it seemed difficult to know what kind of risk I really would be taking — what kind of risks all of us will be taking. Being a journalist, I decided to investigate. I hired three former students to help me canvass the 16 largest institutions of higher education by enrollment, from Boston University to Wentworth Institute of Technology.AdvertisementOur goal was to determine how many people will be at our collective doorstep in September, and how they would be screened for COVID-19. It seemed like the kind of simple number everyone hereabouts might want to know. Our findings were inconclusive, which is disturbing.First, the size of the student influx will be considerably smaller this year — Harvard, UMass-Boston, Berklee, Simmons, and Lesley will all go virtual this fall, which should mean about 60,000 fewer enrolled students. MIT will ask all but seniors to stay home. Given that in 2018 nearly 20 percent of college students in Boston hailed from today’s coronavirus hot spots of Florida, California, and Texas, this offers some relief.But our fact-finding mission got murky from there. Harvard, for instance, expects some 40 percent of its undergraduates to come to campus, even if they do attend classes online. And behemoths like BU, Northeastern, and Tufts will welcome the majority of their students back this semester, as will Bentley, Boston College, Emerson, and Brandeis. Northeastern, for instance, expects roughly 75 percent of its full-time students to attend courses in person, though administrators noted that even that figure can change day by day.“I would say I am very, very concerned,” says Michael Mina, a Harvard epidemiologist, and a proponent of a totally new approach to testing that is beginning to win support. Mina believes that states should buy and distribute hundreds of millions of cheap tests. Their accuracy isn’t perfect, but they’re good enough to monitor the spread of the coronavirus if given en masse. “The idea is to shift from diagnostics to surveillance,” Mina says. “You’re not going to a doctor to find out what’s wrong with you. You’re testing yourself to identify community transmission.”AdvertisementNone of the universities on our list have enacted such radical screening measures. Instead they’ll be testing students and staff at least once weekly, and in many cases, more often. Even so, the truth, as my small team discovered, is that no one knows exactly how many people are coming to Boston in the coming weeks, and we will all be largely dependent on their individual vigilance in order for us to avoid a return to the dark days of April.There’s an awful irony here, as much of the demographic that can best adapt to online learning, college students, will return to campus. The demographic that can least afford to be away from school and is the least likely to become a vector for the disease — elementary students — will be largely kept home. It is another in 2020′s long and dispiriting list of policy failures.Despite all of this, I declined to teach remotely. My reasoning is based on both my heart and my brain. My heart tells me that, having just completed a year of sabbatical, I have a selfish urge to be back behind the lectern. Teaching — learning — is a physical act, a performance in which the audience is inextricable from the performer, a duet of sorts: the inspired improvisation that brings home a complex idea; the half-raised hand that may represent widespread confusion among one’s students. There’s a reason why the basic format of the classroom hasn’t changed since Socrates.AdvertisementBut my other justification is logical. A. David Paltiel — a Yale epidemiologist who recently worked with Massachusetts General Hospital’s chief of infectious disease, Rochelle Walensky, to create recommendations for university reopenings — points out that students pose a risk of transmission wherever they are, and it may well be the case that the lesser risk is placing them in a controlled environment in which they receive frequent screening. Paltiel and Walensky, like Michael Mina, think universities should use frequent, cheap, less-accurate tests that can return results in real time. In almost every instance a false negative would be caught the next day, before a super spreading event can take place.Northeastern, Tufts, and the other universities planning on bringing students back to the classroom fall short of this mark, but not by much. Northeastern is requiring all its students to quarantine for two weeks before coming onto campus, at which point they will be tested three times before entering a classroom. After that they will be tested every five days, using the so-called “gold standard” of genetic, or PCR, testing, which is extremely accurate. Northeastern has ramped up its life sciences department to process its own tests, to the tune of 5,000 tests per day. Not too shabby. The Broad Institute, a research center that is operated by Harvard and MIT, expects to be able to process up to 100,000 tests a day, and its capacity will be used by such schools as Lesley and Tufts.AdvertisementFar from posing a threat to the communities in which these students live, letting students come back under a fairly rigorous testing program will allow the university to act as a kind of early warning system for Boston, identifying clusters of cases before they become hot spots, says Northeastern’s vice provost for research, David Luzzi. Mina thinks that claim might go a bit too far, but he agrees the testing that’s planned should go a long way toward keeping risks low, assuming adherence to other mitigation measures.Indeed, I’ve spent hours in long lines this summer waiting to be tested in private clinics, only to be told that test results will take 10 to 14 days, so the level of rigor promised by these large institutions seems like a tantalizing dream. Starting Monday I will have access to COVID-19 test results in 36 hours.The systems being offered aren’t ideal, but they’re probably the best we’re going to find outside of the NBA bubble. Come Sept. 8, students will return to my campus. I’ll be there, in the classroom, well-masked and ready to greet them.Corey Dockser, Seamus McAvoy, and Ava Sasani contributed reporting.

0,"Can you bless our quarantine room?' In a city scarred by the coronavirus, a priest revives a nervous parish",https://news.yahoo.com/bless-quarantine-room-city-scarred-184604646.html,"In all his years walking into homes with a little white bottle of holy water, the Rev. Kristopher Cowles had never received a request like the recent one when a parishioner led him to a basement and pointed to a bed near a poster of the Virgin Mary and a carton of Clorox wipes.“Can you bless our quarantine room?” said Ciriaco Barrera, a 64-year-old pork worker who secluded himself in the spot earlier this year only to see the disease take hold of his wife and daughter. “We can’t let it get us again.”Cowles whispered a prayer and made the sign of the cross. He walked upstairs back into the light. He said goodbye to Barrera and drove through a city — like countless others across this land — that endured what even the faithful found almost impossible to bear.The Smithfield hog processing plant where Barrera works sorting pigs for slaughter remains home to one of the worst single workplace outbreaks of COVID-19 in the nation. Two deaths and more than 900 infections in the spring led to a weeks-long closure, a backlog on pig farms, and a crippling fear among the thousands of immigrants and war refugees from dozens of countries who dominate the workforce.Through it all, Our Lady of Guadalupe and its husky pastor, who's partial to the Gospel of John and composes homilies on the fly, have stayed resilient in a small, dimly lit brick church with a bright turquoise ceiling northeast of downtown. The only Catholic Latino congregation in this half of South Dakota, a third of its parishioners are plant workers; the others have jobs cleaning hospitals and hotels or in construction and restaurants.Most have gotten sick or know someone who has.Cowles has knelt in their living rooms and stood on their porches. He has heard their sins and eased their burdens. He has his struggles, too, taking medication to battle depression and anxiety that would otherwise flare up during the darkest days of the last months. But congregant and preacher are joined by devotion and pain, and by what the virus has taught them about themselves and their city, which, like much of the country, is desperate to reclaim what it was before the disease landed here last winter.Cowles led the funeral for a community member who died, and anointed another last month who recovered from the virus only to die of stomach cancer. He lit prayer candles when his secretary went into isolation as her parents became ill. For much of the flock, home visits, Facebook Live videos and phone calls replace Mass at the now half-empty church, where rope blocks every other pew and hymnals are stacked away.“We used to run out of space for everyone who wanted to come before the coronavirus tore through,” said Cowles, a 36-year-old with an overgrown buzz cut and thick red beard that is barely covered by his black mask. “Now, I don’t know when they will all be back.”“So I go to them.”Sioux Falls, the state’s biggest city, where Smithfield is among the biggest employers, appears in many ways to have moved beyond the virus.Maskless bachelorettes jam downtown bars on Phillips Avenue on muggy weekends. Indoor rodeos, minor league baseball and high school wrestling tournaments pack the summer season. New cases grow each day alongside statewide flare-ups, like a recent cluster that shut down a Christian summer camp by Mt. Rushmore that had ties to a Sioux Falls church. Still, the city boasts of consecutive days with zero deaths even as the virus surges in most corners of the nation.Fewer workers call in sick now at Smithfield, where temperature checks, masks and face shields became the norm after it joined dozens of meat factories in shutting down. A high school parking lot test site for workers has closed and the corporation, under investigation by the federal government, has released only limited data on the virus at its properties. The company recently ran full-page ads in newspapers across the country, including The Times, criticizing “inaccurate media reports” about its handling of outbreaks and praising the “unsung heroes” it employs.Yet for those reporting to the killing and processing floors on North Weber Avenue, the threat is real.It’s a lurking, unwelcome guest who this community of new Americans, many of them Latino immigrants and others Asian and African refugees, pray never returns.“Our Lady will protect us,” said Barrera, who spent six days a week at the factory and ran a 102-degree temperature in March before he was bedridden for a month.He had worked in Department 1 at the plant for 18 years since moving his family from outside Fresno, where he and his wife picked cantaloupes and tomatoes after emigrating from San Salvador. A nephew who lived in town told them about the factory, where jobs paying double the minimum wage were plentiful in a place with affordable houses and cheap gas.Maria Barrera, who worked in Department 26 slicing the fat from carcasses, followed her husband with her own fever. Her cough lasted through May. Their 18-year-old daughter, Daisy, tested positive but quickly recovered.Ciriaco and Maria are back to work, though some coworkers aren’t. Ciriaco, who lost most of his Saturday overtime, said “two people do the work of three"" in his department now.“I’d rather this whole thing just be over,” he said as he peeled off his mask after genuflecting toward the tabernacle, passing Cowles and walking out of church on a recent Sunday.Since it was built in 1926, just 17 years after the factory that now spreads over 45 acres northeast of downtown, Our Lady of Guadalupe has been a parish of factory workers.Back then, the slaughterhouse was called John Morrell and the employees were white men. Today, it’s Smithfield, a Chinese-owned, Virginia-based company that produced 5% of the nation’s pork before the virus sent output plummeting. Its employees speak 80 languages and make up a large slice of the minority population in Sioux Falls, a city of 188,000 where 82% of people are white.The church started off as St. Therese, a name it held until 1996, after Guatemalan, Salvadoran and Mexican immigrants began arriving by the thousands in Sioux Falls. Many came from California as they sought cheaper rents and union wages at Smithfield.The parish is today named after the 16th century apparition in what is now Mexico City of a dark-skinned Virgin Mary. The global church's patroness of the Americas, she is revered by Catholics across borders. Most congregants are Latino, and Mass, once only in English, is now largely in Spanish.Cowles has led the church for six years after seminary in St. Paul, Minn., a short assignment in the state capital of Pierre and two months training with priests in Guadalajara. A native South Dakotan who was raised in Yankton by the Missouri River on the Nebraska border, he sticks out not only by his vestments, but with his pale white skin.He travels around town in an old Toyota Highlander. When he gets days off, Cowles, a former Eagle Scout, camps in the Black Hills National Forest. He collects Batman comics and prizes a beaten up brass and gold chalice gifted to him by the Knights of Columbus, a fraternity of Catholic men. He calls himself a nerd and notes that he has memorized parts of ""The Lord of the Rings.""Cowles is fluent in Spanish, but he’s still learning new words and speaks with a thick American accent. Parishioners poke fun at him for the time years ago when he confused the words “servicio” and “cerveza” while preaching. In a part of the country with few Latino priests that are native speakers, he is forgiven his shortcomings. Cowles long ago stopped typing first drafts of homilies into Google Translate; he now delivers them in a kind of spiritual improvisation.Many these days give a nod to the virus, though often not by name.“Beside the presence of God,"" Cowles said recently, ""that is the one stable thing we have.""Of the nine Catholic churches in Sioux Falls, the coronavirus has rearranged life at Our Lady of Guadalupe in ways unknown at others. Like elsewhere in the nation, the virus has disproportionately hit Latinos in this community, although they make up 5% of the city's population.Some parishes are now packed on weekends, with no ropes cutting off pews. But Mass on Sunday evenings at Our Lady, where Cowles reminds spaced-apart families to spray and wipe their seats before leaving, might draw a few dozen people at most. Like he did in the early days of the pandemic, Cowles still sets up his iPhone on a tripod at Mass to broadcast on Facebook to those who stay home.The priest has stopped wearing a mask at most services; some parishioners still do. He keeps a pump bottle of hand sanitizer next to the altar, in case he accidentally touches someone’s mouth as they kneel to receive Communion on their tongue.Summer is usually packed with quinceañera Masses; he's only had one small one so far this year. Some scoffed when he said recently that only immediate family could come to first communions. He offers pre-marriage counseling but has no ceremonies scheduled until 2021.He tells parishioners to have ""patience,"" offering his own example of knowing the pain of being unable to pray with his mother. For months, Cowles could only see her through a closed window at her nursing home. Now they visit on a patio, wearing masks and sitting behind nets that keep them 10 feet apart. They shout to hear each other, and end their reunions with air hugs.""Church is open. And we’re not open,” Cowles said, noting that his bishop hasn’t reinstated the religious obligation to attend in person. “We have to respect those who want to come in. And those who don’t.”The Barreras returned to Our Lady together in June.When the building wasn’t open for Mass, Ciriaco would stop by alone for adoration, where the Eucharist would be exposed each night for silent prayer. He would light candles for the family at a niche in front of a print of Our Lady in her turquoise tilma. Maria, whose lingering cough and pulmonary hypertension kept her away longer, now won’t go in the building without her disposable mask.“I believe it was the prayers in church while I was gone that healed me,” said Maria, 50, on a recent Sunday. “I’m happy not being sick. But I’m happier being back in church.”Ana Paulina Magaña, the parish secretary, is in the pews again, though her absence was shorter. The virus infected her parents, cousin and cousin’s husband — a Smithfield worker — earlier this year, and Magaña locked herself in at home with her nieces and brother for weeks.“I never got sick but I know because of my family I can,” said Magaña, 36. Church is one of the few places she tolerates being in big groups without a mask. ""I avoid Walmart because it has too many people.""Esmeralda Rivas, whose family has gone to the parish for 12 years after moving from Washington state, is also back at Mass with her five kids and husband, who works in Department 8 slicing pork ribs. He dodged the sickness, though nearly everyone he ate lunch with in the break room wasn't as lucky, and a worker the next department over died.“God, watch over us all,” said Rivas, 39, who believes it was a force bigger than her that spared her family.As life returns to a new version of normal, Cowles has fielded applications to the diocese's relief fund, which took calls weekly for help from those who were sick or had lost jobs. The church has written dozens of $500 checks to cover rent and medical bills, making up a small part of unemployment pay that applicants, many of them undocumented immigrants, can't get. Most were non-Catholics or churchgoers from outside his parish.But on occasion, he's seen familiar names among those needing help that listed the same workplace: Smithfield.Times staff writer Julia Barajas contributed to this report.(This is the second in a series of occasional stories on the coronavirus’ effect on the Sioux Falls Smithfield plant and its workers.)"

Welcome to the program. Thank you, Maureen. First of all, how much below that threshold did San Diego get on Wednesday? Right. So the case rate dropped to 94.1 new cases per 100,000 residents. The state, as you mentioned in your intro, wants to us to be at no more than 100 new cases per 100,000 residents. So just about six points below what we want, you know, but we we've seen the case rate number fluctuate up and down in the past.Speaker 1:                                             02:00                                             Um, so it will likely change day to day, but you know, every everyone's hoping these ups will still stay below that 100 per 100,000 threshold. And when was the last time we had a positive case number as low as this, we got on the watch list in early July. And so that means that in early July, we went above 100 per 100,000. Um, so it's been a while we're talking five, six weeks here that we've been consistently, um, at above above 100. And I think we've been at 150, 154 cases per 100,000 residents before, you know, later in July, but it's been coming down pretty steadily over the last couple of weeks. So that's, that's been an improvement that we've seen, but this is not the positivity rate, correct. This is the total number of people who test positive. So conceivably the rate could be affected by the number of tests taking place, right? The audience is hearing positivitySpeaker 3:                                             03:00                                             Rate case rate hospitalization, like so many rates that we keep hearing. So the case rate is the number of confirmed cases, confirmed positive results over a two week period. Uh, that's that's divided for, for every 100,000 residents and that's a simplified explanation of the calculation. And so the rate could be influenced by testing. Sure. Um, but you know, except for two or three days over the last month, um, you know, when we saw very low testing around 4,000 daily tests reported or very high testing around 16,000 daily tests reporting, the range has really been around 5,600 to a bit over 9,000 data tests reported with a handful of days above 10,000. Sorry if that was confusing for the audience to follow, but you know, it's about a month ago, the County and state, you know, also didn't limit who could be tested. So it's limited to those who are very sick or, or at high risk, at least those, they took priority. You know, meaning we are testing people who could be more likely to be causative. Our goal is to see a 67, about 6,700 tests a day. And lately, for the most part we've been near or above thatSpeaker 1:                                             04:09                                             Now one day for San Diego to be below threshold numbers does not get us off the watch list. As I understand it, what would we have to do to get off that list?Speaker 3:                                             04:20                                             So just to get off the watch list, you have to day below the threshold for, uh, or at the threshold for three days. Now this is a little bit complicated because we hear about, we heard about that reporting glitch. Um, the state may have not accurately reported all of the cases to the counties and that just caused a whole bunch of confusion. Now, the County says that they've received all of those backdated case positives, um, and maybe there'll be a few trickling in here and there over the next couple of days. And then the state, I believe says that everything should be kind of up to date as of the end of this week. So we still have to wait and see if we do maintain this, this, uh, below this threshold for the next couple of days, what will happen? Will the state allow us to get off the, the watch list? Um, so that's something we're still kind of a little unclear onSpeaker 1:                                             05:08                                             What daily positive test number do we have to stay below to stay below that threshold of 100 per 100,000 resumes?Speaker 3:                                             05:16                                             So dr. Wilmer, Lou and the county's public health officer has said for a while now that, um, if we stay, if we report no more than 240 cases a day for two weeks, we will be able to get off the list and stay there. So 240 is the goal. I mean, but if you look back, you'll see that there has been many, a days recently where we have not been, um, at, or below that number, but we still have been lower than we have been in the past. So the County says that's what allowed us to, to, um, reduce our case rate. But if we want to, to really stay there with confidence, dr. Wilma Wooten has said 240 or fewer new daily is what we need to stay at and hold there for two weeks.Speaker 1:                                             06:00                                             Governor Newsome announced some hopeful news for the state during his COVID briefing yesterday, what did he report?Speaker 3:                                             06:07                                             So he focused a lot on the, um, hospitalizations and, and those that are in ICU for COVID. And we saw decreases, um, about 19% with hospitalizations over the last two weeks and decreases of ICU admissions, I think about 16%. And so this is, um, this is a really, really, um, easy, easy number to track. And it's really, uh, it really tells it gives us a better sampling of them cases, because as you mentioned, that can kind of fluctuate with testing. Um, so this is really, really a good indicator of how we're improving, um, on, um, reducing the spread of COVID by seeing these numbers go down. So he was very happy about that. And we've seen similar trends here in San Diego are hospitalizations. Number of hospitalizations have, have fallen as well.Speaker 1:                                             06:55                                             And getting back to San Diego for a, sort of the full picture, what were the new numbers on deaths and outbreaks?Speaker 3:                                             07:02                                             So we're still seeing, you know, deaths are still, we're still seeing them reported and we're still seeing outbreaks now outbreaks. I can say that, um, for a while we were doing well and what San Diego wants us to stick to is no more than six community outbreaks reported in a week period. Well, we have been way above that for a long time. And so, you know, we reached 40 outbreaks reported in one week period, and then we were, we were coming down, we're still kind of coming down, but we're still pretty high. Like the County reported 26 community outbreaks, um, were confirmed in the last seven days. So still very high, but a little bit better than we saw earlier. That's, we're still seeing people. Um, we're still seeing reports of people of dying. Uh, there was, I believe, six or eight reported, um, over a couple of days, each day, this week we've seen large numbers, um, fewer numbers. Um, but you know, people are still dying from this.Speaker 1:                                             07:56                                             The new testing site opened yesterday at the San Ysidro border. What is the County hoping to achieve with that new siteSpeaker 3:                                             08:03                                             Providing up to 200 daily tasks for people who are authorized to cross over from Mexico into the U S these are usually essential workers. And we know that hospitals in the South Bay have been overwhelmed with a patient's COVID patients. And I had a high percentage of those that have recently traveled to Mexico. So we, this is an effort by the County to provide more resources at the border to just provide, um, provide help where, where the metrics are showing it's needed.Speaker 1:                                             08:31                                             I've been speaking with KPBS health reporter, Karen mento, and Taran. Thank you.Speaker 3:                                             08:35                                             Thank you.Speaker 1:                                             08:53                                             The pandemic goes beyond statistics andSpeaker 4:                                             08:56                                             Charts. For many families, their worlds have been completely devastated by laws. One local theater company is turning their memories and stories into original songs to honor, and eulogize lives lost during the pandemic here's KPBS arts editor and producer Julia Dickson Evans with the storySpeaker 5:                                             09:15                                             Blind spot collective, a San Diego based theater company has made a name for themselves in recent years with inclusive site specific works, including being featured in the LA Jolla playhouses without walls festival. This summer they've launched refractions, which is a project that creates human anthems, original songs written to honor lives lost during the pandemic. The first song blindspot produced honored the memory of Juliet Davis. Her son, TAVI McNeil told Davis his story to songwriters, Brian, Barbara and Kendrick dial, who wrote mama is going to work it outSpeaker 4:                                             10:03                                             [inaudible]Speaker 5:                                             10:03                                             Well, that pandemic has sidelined blind spots, operations. In many ways, artistic director, Blake McCarty said it has also created a sort of intersection of the values. The company strives forSpeaker 4:                                             10:15                                             It, challenges, performing artists to really reimagine what it is. Theater can look like.Speaker 5:                                             10:21                                             They've also long been interested in telling true first person documentary style stories, verbatim theater or documentary theater is a specific form of nonfiction, drama, and playwriting that involves conducting interviews and transforming them into script. During the pandemic, when family is affected by losses or sickness become statistics spot wanted to put those skills to work and honor victims by telling their stories.Speaker 4:                                             10:49                                             Every piece of dialogue is something that is, it is real and authentic from an interview source. And so every character is based specifically on a real person and their true and real experiencesSpeaker 5:                                             11:13                                             Pulling from stories and interviews helps humanize and memorialize something bigger than just one person.Speaker 4:                                             11:21                                             Documentaries are not truth. They are still someone's perspective. The ability to actually like embrace someone's reality without making that reality sort of monolithic in any way.Speaker 5:                                             11:33                                             Shelina Hafner one of the artists leading the project said storytelling is critical while communities are struggling with grief, but it's a role that she and many other performers are missing right now with stages shuttered. At least for me, our job is to create empathy and it's to tell stories. Um, and a lot of us, right, aren't doingSpeaker 4:                                             11:54                                             That. But with the fact that all of theseSpeaker 5:                                             12:04                                             Numbers that were flooded with on television and we're losing the, the individualSpeaker 4:                                             12:11                                             In this moment,Speaker 5:                                             12:13                                             You know, we see like 300 new cases yesterday and we think, Oh, that's a lot. You know, and people get, I think that we're losing who those people are. The group pairs, grieving families with songwriters and performers to produce original music with lyrics taken directly from the interviews and conversations with LA.Speaker 4:                                             12:35                                             I missed the sound of your voice. Every echo of your wisdom, sing songs of your someone saving me from myself. I know you're still watching me.Speaker 5:                                             12:43                                             They first gathered stories from families using one-on-one interviews. It's a way to get to know a person beyond the statistics, the things they loved, their catchphrases and what the friends and family remember about them. They also ask what kind of music the person liked and the types of music the family listens to together in the absence of public funerals. This process parallels the human need to eulogize their loved ones. When these songs are shared, they put a face and a story to the human toll of the person.Speaker 4:                                             13:13                                             You still feel you still live. You still, still, still love.Speaker 5:                                             13:24                                             TAVI McNeil said his mother Juliet had raised him with music and loved music during her life. The song was exactly what it needed to be.Speaker 4:                                             13:54                                             That was KPBS arts editor, Julia Dickson Evans blind spot collective is still gathering stories from families who wish to honor loved ones. You can find out how to get involved@kpbs.org. I'm Mark Sauer with Maureen Kavanaugh and you're listening to KPBS mid day edition. The Biden Harris democratic ticket is set, but roughly 80 days out the November 3rd election seems imperiled. The president today said he will block Democrats request for aid to the postal service. Social media is besieged by foreign trolls and COVID-19 fears cloud in-person voting. Joining me to examine this fraught election year is Richard Hasson professor of law and political science at the university of California, Irvine and author of election meltdown, dirty tricks, distrust, and the threat to American democracy. Welcome to midday edition. It's great to be with you. President of Trump said this morning on Fox news he'll block the Democrats push for postal serviceSpeaker 6:                                             14:52                                             Funding. Let's hear thatSpeaker 7:                                             14:53                                             They want $25 billion billion for the post office. Now they need that money in order to have the post office work. So it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots. Now, in the meantime, they aren't getting there by the way, those are just two items, but if they don't get those two items, that means you can't have universal mail and voting because they're not equipped to have it.Speaker 6:                                             15:16                                             What's your reaction to this professor in order to have a proper election in the middle of a pandemic, many people are going to want to vote by mail and saying that you want to make it harder for people to vote by mail in the middle of a pandemic and doing so for political reasons is profoundly worrying and is just part of a pattern of the president making statements that are intended to make it harder to vote and to undermine people's confidence in the fairness of the election. Now, is there anything to Trump's claims that bad actors and 400 domestic will counterfeit ballots and doctor ballots and steel ballots are committed other election crimes regarding mail and voting. So I think that the amount of voter fraud in the United States is quite low when election crimes do happen, they're more likely to happen using absentee ballots than in person voting.Speaker 6:                                             16:05                                             Uh, but even so the overall rate of absentee ballot fraud is low. And by referring to absentee ballots, I'm talking about absentee and mail in ballots because in my use of the terms, they're really the same thing. And, uh, most of these absentee ballot crimes or prosecutions were ones that would not affect the outcome of an election. I certainly think we could see isolated instances of ballots being tampered with, but to try to tamper with, uh, an election through absentee ballots on any wide-scale would be easily detected. And so I don't think that it really presents a significant risk to the integrity of the election. And you posted a New York times column on your election law blog this week about the blue shift. What is that? And what's it have to do with Trump tweeting that we must know the results on election night. So one of the concerns that I have is that given this shift to mail and balloting, and especially given Trump's statements, which are discouraging Republicans from voting by mail and encouraging Democrats to do so.Speaker 6:                                             17:09                                             And that we might be in a situation where you can imagine, say a swing state like Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. Trump is ahead in the voting on election night, because those are the ballots that are going to be counted. First are going to be those in-person ballots. It takes longer to process absentee ballots to make sure they're done correctly, and that all the anti-fraud provisions are in place. So you can imagine a situation where Trump is ahead on election night. Then we get to maybe a week or even longer later, but all the ballots are counted and Biden has won the election. And the meantime Trump could claim victory based on the election night results and try to make claims as he has in the past that any ballots counted after election day are somehow fraudulent. These are not valid claims. We never have election results, uh, happen.Speaker 6:                                             17:58                                             Uh, immediately there are projections of what's going to happen in California. It takes weeks to count the ballots. And one of the things that we see as Bal even before Trump started making these comments is that because Democrats tend to vote later, uh, the ballots that are counted later have more democratic votes in them. That's why we saw seven congressional races in Southern California in the 2018 elections start with election night leads for Republican congressional candidates. And in all of those races, Democrats were ultimately declared the winner as all of the ballots were counted. That's what the blue shift is. It's the fact that not only can we potentially expect the final election results to be different from the election night results, they're much more likely to favor Democrats. There's nothing nefarious about it is just the voting patterns of how people tend to vote and what we see in terms of election results.Speaker 4:                                             18:49                                             What about foreign interference this time around we've? We followed the Mueller report, a detailed analysis of Russian interference in 2016 intelligence agents say it's happening again? There's reports of interference from China against Trump. How seriously are you taking these threats?Speaker 6:                                             19:04                                             Well, there were different kinds of interference in 2016. One kind of interference is misinformation or attempts to stir up a social trouble. We saw the Russians do that. I think that is troubling. Although I do think that the platforms like Facebook and Twitter are taking some steps to try to root out what they call coordinated, inauthentic behavior, this idea of, uh, you know, using bots or otherwise sending out messages that don't really reflect real people, but instead a kind of political operation, I'm more concerned about other kinds of interference. Or remember in 2016 we saw the stealing and leaking of democratic party documents. So we might see that happen again. Uh, you know, we don't know who's stealing what documents and what might be released. And also what we saw in 2016 was the Russian government probing election registration databases in all 50 States, trying to, uh, show I think that they had some ability to access those databases.Speaker 6:                                             20:03                                             Uh, no information was changed in terms of the results of the 2016 election, but I think it was an attempt to try to undermine people's confidence in the process. Looking forward to the 2020 election. One of the nightmares that I spent out in, uh, election meltdown is the potential of a power grid hack in a democratic city like Detroit in a swing state like Michigan. We don't have good procedures in place if there is that kind of disruption. And I think COVID is on everyone's mind, but I think we can't put aside the potential for there to be problems like foreign, uh, interference, uh, cyber attacks, things like that also occurring as we get closer to the electionSpeaker 4:                                             20:41                                             And much is being said about voter suppression, like drastic cuts and the number of polling places in certain cities. Uh, doSpeaker 6:                                             20:48                                             You worry about that? So I was already worried about the election before COVID hit. Now of course, one of the reasons we're seeing a polling place closures is that it's very hard to staff polling places, especially when you rely on older Americans are most susceptible to the virus, all kinds of reasons to worry that the election, you know, is one, that's not going to look like our typical election. I think we need to make sure that there are safe ways to vote both in person and by mail, especially with these concerns over vote by mail. We may end up seeing more people voting in person and with all the kinds of polling place closures and the procedures that need to be put in place like social distancing and cleaning of voting equipment that needs to happen because of the pandemic. I think we should anticipate the potential for long lines, which is always a potential in places, but I think we might see it in more places.Speaker 6:                                             21:37                                             That's why in-person early voting might be a great option for some people who neither trust the mail or are willing to wait until election day to see what those lines are going to look like. Well, how great a threat is all this to the election, uh, put your, your a crystal ball tap on. What are you fearing? What keeps you up at night? What might happen on November 3rd? Well, everything we've talked about, uh, is the kind of stuff that keeps me up at night from potential cyber attacks, to a lack of opportunities for safe in person voting, uh, to, uh, the president seeking to undermine the fairness and legitimacy of the election. I think what is most likely to lead to what would be considered by many to be a successful election is if the election is not particularly close, because if the election is very close, then you know, there's going to be fighting lawsuits potentially, uh, straight protests over arcane rules for how ballots are cast and counted.Speaker 6:                                             22:31                                             And that's something that really we're not well equipped for 20 years after the Florida debacle, which led to the Supreme court's decision in Bush versus Gore, we're still not prepared to deal with these kinds of, uh, election troubles. And of course it's much worse now with increased polarization and the rise of social media, where the media is watching the voters are watching the whole world will be watching lots to cover here between now and November 3rd. I've been speaking with political science and law professor Richard Hasson of the university of California, Irvine and author of election meltdown, dirty tricks, distrust, and the threat to American democracy. Thanks very much. Thank you for the opportunity.Speaker 1:                                             23:14                                             A number of military families have been left in limbo as they wait to move to new bases.

When her husband received orders, transferring him to Maryland. They were forced to move out in July, but by then, the Navy had put his move on hold with two young kids and no place to live. Their best option was to buy an RV and search for campground.Speaker 5:                                             24:19                                             Finding more permanent housing in an RV is a little challenging. A lot of places require a membership. Um, some places, um, are just booked because most people make these plans months and years in advance. And we are trying to do it last minute.Speaker 8:                                             24:34                                             Her family is one of thousands caught up in the military stop movement order, which went into effect in March in July. The Pentagon began loosening restrictions about 40% of the 230 U S military installations worldwide have reopened because they met requirements like having fewer COVID-19 cases for at least 14 days.

We were able to, uh, get sailors moved because they had a hardship or because they were essential to the mission of the new commandSpeaker 8:                                             25:23                                             Waivers have helped dramatically clear the Navy's backlog. The Navy originally expected. It would take until sometime next year to move the nearly 24,000 waiting families. Now it expects to have the rest of those families at their new bases by November. The number of cases of Corona virus in the military has plateaued in the last week or so though coronavirus cases had been surging through July, even as the Navy was pushing to get more sailors moving tranq says the Navy is convinced it's reopeningSpeaker 7:                                             25:53                                             Because we are taking those steps to keep our people safe.

It's a massacre. I understand that when families see this they tell us 'I'm not taking my child to school',"" she added.Some teachers chanted ""Shame!"" as they stood in line or called on the head of the regional government of Madrid, Isabel Diaz de Ayuso, to resign.Teachers unions have called for several days of strikes this month to decry the ""improvisation"" of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in schools.Carmen, a 58-year-old primary school teacher who declined to give her last name, said she was ""outraged"" that she was summoned at the last minute to be tested and then had to wait in a long line.""They treat us like cattle...They make me want to cry,"" she added.Spain will require all students aged six or older to wear masks when classes resume next week, and is urging them to wash their hands at least five times a day.The country was one of the hardest-hit countries when the coronavirus struck Europe this year before a strict lockdown helped reduce the outbreak's spread.But infections have surged since the lockdown measures were fully removed at the end of June, especially in Madrid, with the rise in infections often linked to the return of nightlife and social gatherings.© 2020 AFPThe content you requested does not exist or is not available anymore."
0,Pandemic Pivot In Swing: NEA Jazz Masters Concert Goes Online As Fans Embrace The Virtual Tip Jar,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyolson/2020/08/13/pandemic-pivot-in-swing-nea-jazz-masters-concert-goes-online-as-fans-embrace-the-virtual-tip-jar/,"NEA Jazz Masters concert - honoring Dorthaan Kirk, Bobby McFerrin, Roscoe Mitchell and Reggie ... [+] Workman - goes virtual on August 20, 2020. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz )Earlier this spring, legendary jazz saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter was struggling with a pile-up of bills to cover his chronic medical needs. Enter SFJazz, which since May has raised a cool $100,000 and counting to help offset those costs by airing a series of Shorter tribute concerts and putting out a virtual tip jar around the performances, recorded in 2019.And that’s just one act of the Bay Area venue and nonprofit’s power plays since the pandemic. SFJazz also fast-tracked a new digital subscription service and in March began releasing weekly concerts that each consistently pulls in $5,000-$15,000. Next week it will showcase its most ambitious feat yet—the virtual incarnation of this year’s NEA Jazz Masters Tribute Concert, which debuts Thursday, August 20 on sites including arts.gov and sfjazz.org.This year’s class—Dorthaan Kirk, Bobby McFerrin, Roscoe Mitchell and Reggie Workman—was to be honored at a concert in April emceed by Dee Dee Bridgewater at the 700-seat Bay Area hall. But as 2020 goes, the live event was forced to pivot, thus challenging its producers to somehow simulate the live experience of an art form that arguably more than any other relies on the cadence of improvisation. “There’s been a massive coordination effort, much more than we’d need to do with a live show,” says SFJazz founder and executive artistic director Randall Kline. “Producing a TV show is basically what it is. It’s going to look live, but they are recording ahead of time. We’re dealing with close to 50 musicians all in remote locations who’ve had to record in a particular way so it feels like it has continuity.” Although Kline says “trying to electronically connect them and make it feel like it’s spontaneous is very, very difficult,” he acknowledges the process is exceeding his expectations. “I don’t want to jinx it at this point, but it’s looking phenomenal, it’s coming together great.” And at a time when jazz fans are proving their willingness to embrace online experiences, the concert has the potential to draw more viewers than in years past.That’s music to the ears of the National Endowment for the Arts, which since 1982 has organized an event, typically staged at the Kennedy Center in D.C., to celebrate the highest honor the country bestows upon jazz musicians.“We were so disappointed when we had to postpone our April plans. There are so many great musicians who have completely lost work. The Arts Endowment does all we can do support artists of all kinds, so it seemed like the right thing to do to go ahead and celebrate this unbelievable class, and do it virtually,” says NEA director of music Ann Meier Baker. “It’s great to be able to employ musicians and to get the chance to make music. We’ve all been starving for it.”To boot, Covid has inflicted a particularly harsh toll on the jazz community. In April pianist and educator Ellis Marsalis died of complications from the disease. The virus has claimed the lives of more than a dozen influential jazz and blues musicians, according to the Jazz Foundation of America. “We’ve lost some Jazz Masters to the pandemic and several have been ill,” Meier Baker says. “And a lot of the Jazz Masters we honor have spent their entire lives working in jazz so they’re older and in a community that’s more at risk. So it’s all the more gratifying for us to be able to do this concert virtually.” After bringing in New Orleans outfit Elephant Quilt Productions, the company behind Preservation Hall Jazz Band’s virtual Legacy Program, SFJazz was up for the challenge—which Kline sums up in one word. “Spontaneity. That’s what jazz is—live is everything. It’s based not just on interaction with the musicians themselves but interaction with the audience. We needed to create something that would feel like a live Jazz Masters Awards ceremony, to set the stage and capture that energy transfer that’s essential to a live performance.”Kirk, McFerrin, Mitchell and Workman each will have time in the remote spotlight, an achievement that’s taken some improv’ing of its own. “We sent out microphones and mic stands and guideline to make it look like they’re playing together live,” Kline says. “Some of the Jazz Masters are not as tech-savvy as others, so we sent them kits and instructions on how to use them. How far away to stand from the mic, how to set up their iPhone, or whatever device they’re using, and try to create some sort of standard.”While the tribute concert is not a fundraiser, it will disseminate information about supporting jazz and jazz musicians at this time. “Because of the federal government, we can’t overtly raise money, but we’re putting up a few preshow slides and throughout the presentation,” says Kline, who hopes those who come through the SFJazz portal also take some time to look around. “Our hope is by coming through our web site they rub up against other things that interest them.”Pass the Tip JarIn fact, SFJazz has been rubbing fans the right way a lot lately, as it extends the tip jar commonly found in jazz clubs to the virtual environment. Its new virtual platform, originally slated to bow in the fall, has seen great success around its “Fridays At 5” concerts where artists interact with fans in chat rooms while they watch one of hundreds of performances recorded in the building since it opened in 2013. More than 9,000 people have signed up to be digital members since March, in addition to the 14,000 general SFJazz members. The virtual shows—available only to SFJazz members, who pay a minimum of $60 per year though Kline notes many give in the three and four figures—draw an average of 3,000 fans and raise up to $15,000 per week in tips. SFJazz then splits the wage with the featured artist.  “The donor group is very important to the SFJazz success story,” Kline says. “They are the superfans. As well as supporting us with an annual donation, they purchase more than 60% of the tickets we sell.”The Shorter StoryThat group also rallied behind Shorter, whose SFJazz story originates in January 2019, when he had to bow out of a four-night series due to health issues. Upon learning that news, jazz’s good will ambassador Herbie Hancock mobilized a group of musicians including Terence Blanchard, Branford Marsalis, Terrace Martin, Joshua Redmond and Kamasi Washington, who volunteered to play each night with Shorter’s trio, salvaging the gigs and keeping Shorter on the receiving end of the fees he would’ve collected.Fast forward to this March. “When the crisis hit, we heard from two musicians close to Wayne that he needed dialysis and was having to go to a public clinic in the midst of Covid. They were trying to get money so he could have something at his house,” Kline says. “My jaw dropped. I couldn’t believe Wayne Shorter couldn’t afford the medical care he needs.”Kline reached out to Shorter’s management, and that of the performers from the 2019 shows with the idea of airing the performances for the first time, with 100% of tip jar proceeds earmarked for Shorter’s medical costs. He got a unanimous standing ovation on rights to air the shows; the series is on track to raise $130,000-$150,000. “Everyone was very moved by this idea, where people could come together for an NEA Jazz Master—and it was another Jazz Master’s idea,” Kline says.I’m an independent journalist with 30 years’ experience covering music, television, digital, brand and culture for business and consumer audiences.

Three major mobile companies – Verizon, Vodafone and Ericsson – have been involved in Aloha’s development over the past couple of years, because of the service’s potential as a way to drive value for users of 5G-capable mobile phones as well as high-speed broadband networks. “The goal was to create the possibility for musicians to play together, to have some sort of audio platform for musicians, where they became another piece of the Internet of Things ecosystem,” said Elk Audio founder and CEO Michele Benincaso, who is based in Stockholm, Sweden. “We have musicians playing together with over 1,000 miles distance in between. It’s basically science fiction.” The big enemy of the remote jam session is delay, what’s called in technology circles “latency.” As the milliseconds of latency pile up, it gets harder and harder for musicians even a few dozens of meters apart in a large room to keep on the same beat. At bottom, the laws of physics cause latency; the speed of light is the fastest thing in the universe, but when sending a signal hundreds of miles across a typical online connection, musicians’ ears can still hear the lag. “The real test is having a jam session improvisation because that's where latency is very, very strict requirement,” Benincaso said.Aloha is designed to reduce those delays while also smoothing out shifting levels of latency that can make it even more difficult to play together. “When it comes to the law of physics, no one is gonna beat that,” Benincaso said. “What is very important is not only the latency itself, but the consistency of the latency.That's a very, very important point, because the musician can adapt, but what they cannot do, they cannot adapt if the latency is not stable.”To save those precious milliseconds, Aloha is built around Elk’s special-purpose operating system for audio devices, which is incorporated into a small device containing an audio processing chip and ports for connecting instruments and internet connections. Aloha also uses an online app to control the service, provide video, and allow chat directly with others.  The idea is to get the devices in the gig bag of every practicing musician, and later begin building the technology directly into musical instruments, so the service is widely available, Benincaso said.It depends on fast broadband networks but ultimately will thrive best when 5G mobile networks are widely available. Those networks promise to dramatically reduce mobile latency issues. The potential of the service to help drive 5G adoption is why mobile powerhouses Vodafone, Verizon 
 
VZ
 and Ericsson have been helping Elk with Aloha’s development, including showcases at major industry showcases such as Mobile World Congress and NAMM. “We were looking for things that you could do with low latency that you cannot do without it,” said Santiago Tenorio, Vodafone’s head of network architecture. “It wasn't until the lockdown when people realized, ‘Oh, there is something here.’ You cannot really play together if the latency is not good enough. That made all this a completely different thing, which has a lot of value, and it's not just for music, it's got value for education as well, and anything interactive.”Vodafone operates in 28 countries, and has been rolling out 5G networks for a year now, beginning with major cities in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain, in whose capital Tenorio is based. Similarly, Verizon has been in a race to rollout its 5G networks across the United States, especially ahead of this fall’s expected debut of 5G-enabled Apple iPhones. Tenorio said Vodafone has no imminent plans to commercialize Aloha, but is thinking about ways to optimize its own network architectures to make the technology even more efficient. Like Benincaso, he said many of the potential applications of 5G will only become apparent with time, much as happened when 3G networks enabled the smart phone, and 4G enabled location-driven technologies such as Uber and navigation. “We're still focused very much on the technology we're experimenting on and I think that's almost an endless game, every millisecond counts, and there are milliseconds everywhere,” Tenorio said. “So there is a lot that we can do to make this work (from) farther away, or better, or can we have more people connected? What the carrier can do is to slice it and streamline it and make it as efficient as it can be.”Trying to connect long-distance has become distressingly commonplace for many musicians amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and not just for jam sessions, Benincaso said. Long-distance collaborations between, say, prominent record producers in Sweden and their musician clients in New York can be enabled with the technology, reducing to a usable level the cross-ocean delays enough that they can get work done together. Elk’s website features video of jamming musicians who it says are able to play together even though they are 450 miles apart. Remote performances like that also can be streamed to audiences watching from afar using the technology. In somewhat similar fashion, the technology also holds promise for remote learning, allowing teachers to work with groups of online students in a setting fluid enough to be useful for everyone.Benincaso, an Italian based in Stockholm the past 13 years, has training in both classical music and violin building. After getting a master’s degree in violin construction in 2000, he focused on combining music and technology.He partnered with a professor at Sweden’s Royal College of Technology who specializes in wireless sensors to build “the guitar of the future,” as he put it. The first step was building the Elk Audio Operating System, designed to optimize the handling of sound. The Aloha release is the next step, to be followed by further optimization of the system using deep-learning techniques, Benincaso said. Prices for the standalone audio device will be determined in the next couple of months, but he said it would be “very inexpensive.” “At the end, the musician doesn’t care about the technology, the musician cares about the experience,” Benincaso said.I’m a Los Angeles-based columnist, speaker, podcaster and consultant focused on the collision of tech, media and entertainment.

One valuable source of insight into this state is the concept of liminality from social anthropology. Arnold van Gennep, a French anthropologist, coined the term in the early 20th century to describe the threshold period between two phases of life — for instance, what adolescents might experience during certain rites of passage. During a crisis, liminality can be a pervasive, shared experience for people across communities. Learning to harness the benefits of liminality is helpful for coping with the challenges of COVID-19 and is also important beyond the pandemic, given the likelihood of aftershocks from or recurrences of the coronavirus crisis and the emergence of other uncertain events in the future.

This threshold period also heightens our sense of community, offering scope for spontaneous cooperation, even among nontraditional allies, in what Richard Hytner at London Business School describes as a “climate of collaboration and a spirit of insurgency.” However, this fleeting spirit of solidarity may also induce passivity if people begin to take added support for granted. Liminality can also be a period of capability-building for people and teams, given that prior expertise will often have to be modified, augmented, or replaced to meet challenges in the next phase. However, these transformations may go awry if people improvise too much or act impulsively.  The trick for leaders is to harness the upsides of the in-between phase of crisis while avoiding accompanying pitfalls. Three strategies have helped companies meet the demands of the current crisis and will be worth holding on to as we look toward the future. (See “Harnessing the In-Between Stages of a Crisis.”)  
Creativity  Scope to leverage cognitive liberation and identify new possibilitiesPanic  Prospect of being disoriented due to confounded sensemakingPivot Calmly  Recalibrate the offering to address new pain points by using what’s at handCooperation  Scope to build new relationships and collaborate, including with dissimilar othersPassivity  Susceptible to being lulled into taking sources of external support for grantedConnect Actively  Avail external support, recognizing that it may be only temporarily on offerCapability-Learning  Enlist available help to improvise and build new capabilities by embracing changeImpulsivity  Vulnerable to reckless improvisation that impedes effective transformationLearn Without Overreaching  Quickly build new expertise that’s in sync with one’s DNA

1. Pivot calmly using resources at hand. An antidote for panic is working with what is at hand — a principle that anthropologists call bricolage. This might mean augmenting an offering with readily available — and relevant — components. For instance, Shanghai-based health care startup HiNounou first added face masks and hand sanitizer to its health-monitoring kit for elders to use during COVID-19 and eventually released this kit to the wider market as it became broadly relevant. Another approach is refashioning an existing offering in one realm to make it applicable to another. SenseGiz, a startup that originated in the southern Indian city of Belgaum, applied its expertise in monitoring home and office safety to a social distancing and COVID-19 patient-tracing application that won first prize at an innovation challenge organized by the Indian government. Another celebrated example is ventilators being fashioned out of diving masks.In contrast to these examples, a young entrepreneur I spoke to within the past few months panicked because the lockdown in his city and associated travel restrictions meant that he simply could not pursue his plan A. He tried to pivot using an expensive new feature that required users to install equipment that was not easy to procure. Thus his knee-jerk reaction was neither sensible nor, in the end, feasible. Working with resources at hand, as opposed to worrying about hard-to-obtain resources, helps managers and entrepreneurs enhance their belief that they, rather than external circumstances, control outcomes. This, in turn, can mitigate initial anxiety or panic brought on by the ambiguity of a crisis. This approach makes practical sense for many companies during a crisis, given that their resource base typically doesn’t expand. If anything, it shrinks. 2. Connect actively, recognizing that support may be temporary. Recognizing the temporary nature of the current situation and, therefore, of available support and resources could be a wake-up call for organizations that prompts proactive change. The U.S. Geological Survey has captured the spirit of solidarity many groups are experiencing in its compilation of open innovation projects focused on COVID-19: One of its lists, titled “The Unusual Players — Spontaneous Efforts,” includes a contribution from a 17-year-old high-school student. In other words, liminality can bring on a Dunkirk-like spirit of spontaneity when actors who normally don’t work with one another are willing to pitch in and help. On the other end of the spectrum, a colleague recently described an email he had received from a company for which he had volunteered to mentor as conveying a sense of lethargy; its leaders didn’t feel ready to brainstorm and wanted to wait for the dust of the current crisis to settle. What they didn’t seem to grasp is that my colleague’s offer wouldn’t be available indefinitely. Recognizing that external support may be fleeting can instill a sense of urgency that offers an antidote to the danger of slipping into passivity.In times of uncertainty, early investors and mentors often provide advice and serve as a useful sounding board. Cisco LaunchPad, a corporate accelerator, has provided support for alumni startups — like the previously mentioned SenseGiz — on technology enablement and market access to meet needs arising from the pandemic. Also valuable is generous scaffolding like the Australian Information Industry Association’s business continuity initiative, which provides access to free business services and tools that facilitate remote working arrangements. When partnering with organizations and providers that are dissimilar from one’s own, tapping the expertise inherent in programs that can help match various solutions with corporate needs can help greatly. For companies, it’s important to recognize that the journey between stages does not have to be a lonely one — but ensuring that will require active effort and engagement. 3. Learn without overreaching by being consistent with one’s DNA. If companies follow the preceding strategies of calmly (No. 1) yet proactively (No. 2) working with internal (or adjacent) resources and external networks, they are more likely to avoid the risk of reckless overreach, by staying true to their DNA as they improvise. Crowdz, a Silicon Valley startup focusing on supply chain finance, recognized a new opportunity to target the small and medium-sized business (SMB) market, as opposed to its traditional customers, who were large trading companies. It pivoted by shifting its messaging and business, based on the technical and business expertise that were already at hand, to show SMBs how they could prequalify for invoice financing. Crowdz found that it could tap into a newfound spirit of generosity among large companies that wanted their SMB suppliers to survive the current economic crisis. Building on these moves, Crowdz then recognized the need to quickly develop new expertise, consistent with its DNA, to build a new feature — in this case, the ability to basket invoices for external funders. Crowdz improvised in a way that was effective yet not impulsive, which helped it avoid overreaching. This type of approach proves successful because even after a liminal transformation, the core values and DNA of a company are likely to remain the same. For managers, a nuanced understanding of the transitional stage we’re in is critical. While the need to guard against the pitfalls of panic, passivity, and impulsivity can be easy to overlook, taking care to do so will make it more likely that well-intentioned efforts — in terms of creativity, cooperation, and capability-building — are truly not wasted. Shameen Prashantham is a professor of international business and strategy at China Europe International Business School. In addition to his extensive research on what he calls “dancing with gorillas” — partnering between large corporations and startups — he has studied liminality in organizations that are going international, and strategy formulation.You must sign in to post a comment.First time here?

0,The novel coronavirus might be even deadlier than 1918 Spanish flu,https://bgr.com/2020/08/14/coronavirus-death-rate-vs-1918-spanish-flu-study/,"Comparisons to the flu were common in the early days of the novel coronavirus pandemic, but it soon became clear that the illness did not behave like the flu. The coronavirus is far more contagious. Also, patients can be asymptomatic, or they can exhibit all sorts of symptoms, including unusual ones that might not necessarily be associated with an infectious disease. Finally, we learned that COVID-19 can leave long-lasting effects on the bodies of survivors, and that it kills more people than the seasonal flu. Without universal access to effective treatment, we have to continue to socially distance, wear face masks, and wash our hands as often as possible. A new study suggests that COVID-19 could be even more devastating than the 1918pandemic when you take into account the advances of modern medicine.Researchers compared the mortality of the 1918 flu pandemic to COVID-19 deaths and found that the novel coronavirus is at least as deadly as the flu that ravaged the world more than a century ago.“What we want people to know is that this has 1918 potential,” Dr. Jeremy Faust told CNBC. “This is not something to just shrug off like the flu.” He said that the outbreak in New York was at least 70% as bad as the one in 1918 when doctors did not have ventilators and other medical advances that could have helped them save lives.“If insufficiently treated, SARS-CoV-2 infection may have comparable or greater mortality than 1918 H1N1 influenza virus infection,” the researchers wrote in the paper, which was published in the JAMA Network Open journal.The scientists looked at data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the US Census Bureau for their analysis. They compared excess deaths in New York City during the peak of the 1918 pandemic with the COVID-19 deaths in the first months of the outbreak.The flu deaths were higher overall, but they were comparable to the deaths observed in New York in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. “However, because baseline mortality rates from 2017 to 2019 were less than half that observed from 1914 to 1917 (owing to improvements in hygiene and modern achievements in medicine, public health, and safety), the relative increase during early COVID-19 period was substantially greater than during the peak of the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic,” the researchers wrote. The researchers said the main limitation of the study is that the direct comparison of the 1918 H1N1 strain and the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not possible. Also, it’s unknown how many deaths of COVID-19 were prevented because of access to modern inventions that were not available during the 1918 flu pandemic.Even so, the findings can serve as a warning of the worst case scenario. If outbreaks can’t be contained, there may be scenarios where hospitals won’t have enough resources to treat all patients. It’s not enough to have modern medicine on your side if your local hospital can’t handle the flood of cases.“We believe that our findings may help officials and the public contextualize the unusual magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to more prudent policies that may help to decrease transmission by decreasing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the exhaustion of essential supplies of life-saving resources in the coming weeks and beyond,” the researchers wrote.There’s also good news in this warning. Modern medicine does work against an unknown pathogen like the novel coronavirus. And COVID-19 therapy might get even better in the not so distant future.The 1918 pandemic killed 50 million people worldwide according to estimate. COVID-19 killed more than 750,000 people as of Friday afternoon, out of more than 21.27 million cases. The US registered the world’s largest number of COVID-19 cases, at more than 5.4 million, and the most deaths, at over 170,000.Copyright 2020 BGR Media, LLCPMC Entertainment"
0,The coronavirus pandemic — seen it all before in the movies?,https://www.dw.com/en/the-coronavirus-pandemic-seen-it-all-before-in-the-movies/a-54622263,"We use cookies to improve our service for you. You can find more information in our data protection declaration.A film expert looked into how TV series and cinema foreshadowed the COVID-19 pandemic years ago. Here's why we should have been watching more closely.Should we have seen this coming? Should politicians, scientists and social institutions simply have watched more movies? Haven't numerous pandemic films and TV series in fact shown what happens when diseases spread around the globe at breakneck speed?These are questions we should deal with even if no one claims that fictional movie and TV material should be used one-on-one to plan the future.Film expert Denis Newiak analzyed various films and TV series about pandemicsPandemic not surprising, says film expertWhat most surprised German media and film expert Denis Newiak was how unprepared everyone was, how overwhelmed people were — especially politicians, for example in the US. ""It is incredible that people have been watching these kinds of films and series for the past 10 years, but now, they are surprised,"" Newiak told DW.While working on his doctoral thesis on loneliness in film and television and the community-building functions of TV series, Newiak also came across the topic of pandemics in film and TV — and wrote a book on his findings: Alles schon dagewesen: Was wir aus Pandemie-Filmen für die Corona-Krise lernen können (It's all been there before: What we can learn from films about pandemics for the coronavirus crisis). The book has just hit the market, a hot topic just months after the outbreak of a pandemic that has not yet run its course.It was soon clear this was an ""issue that would be relevant at some point, experts have been warning about it for a long time,"" said Newiak, who has experience working in emergency management and has also worked as a volunteer paramedic. A classic pandemic film: Steven Soderbergh's 'Contagion' starring Kate WinsletAfter spending countless hours in movie theaters and watching TV, Newiak said he found it ""astonishing"" ""that a pandemic has been played out so vividly on the screen so many times, that millions of people saw the shows — but still the hospitals and the governments ran out of medical-grade face masks so quickly."" While he didn't want to accuse anyone in a global crisis, he said, ""the films and series should be a warning not to underestimate real dangers and to better prepare ourselves for them while we have the chance.""But should we turn to film and TV shows for advice? Can the disaster genre provide concrete models for the planet?Newiak is convinced that mankind can learn a lot from fictional scenarios — and points out Phase 7, the 2010 satirical film from Argentina about a pandemic that ""goes into great detail about the way people handle wearing face masks.""Some characters in the film are taken by surprise by the crisis: ""People don't really perceive how the world around them is coming to an end. They put on face masks — just like we sometimes see people today on TV news broadcasts — haphazardly, or not at all, or their noses aren't properly covered."" People watching the film two years ago wouldn't have cared about such details, Newiak said, but today, that ""takes on a whole new urgency.""The film expert noticed the subtleties in several pandemic films but he also concluded that ""the genre deals with larger issues like fake news and conspiracy theories; it looks at how businesses profit from fear and sales of ineffective fake drugs as well as how society increasingly becomes polarized.""The 2007 Hollywood blockbuster I am Legend is another good example, according to Newiak. Will Smith plays a man who believes he is the only survivor in New York of a global virus outbreak. How does the character deal with this sudden loneliness?Pandemic genre films often feature characters that have to come to terms with loneliness, who have to remain isolated and stay home because it's too dangerous outdoors, Newiak said.The last man alive in New York: Will Smith and a dog in 'I am Legend'I am Legend shows how the protagonist tries to deal with life as the alleged last person on earth. That may be crass, Newiak said, but ""the phenomenon that people suddenly find themselves having to work permanently from home, or find themselves in quarantine, can within certain limits be transferred to the filmic narrative world in a way that provides insight."" And people usually draw the parallels between fiction and reality, he added.The film suggests, he said, that daily routines are important, ""including regular meal times and physical exercise, perhaps growing your own fruit and vegetables, keeping your home tidy as well as getting in touch with virtual communities, precisely via film and television, that allow people to continue to take part in society.""The German-Danish TV series 'Sloborn' offers frighteningly realistic scenesWatching films in preparation of crisis situations is not that far-fetched, according to Newiak. ""People enjoy films and TV programs primarily as entertainment, but of course they always unconsciously absorb patterns of behavior from these series and movies,"" he argued. People remember the bits they can use in their everyday lives or in exceptional situations, he added.Newiak is convinced that in particular series offer plenty of tips for everyday situations. ""It's not just a phenomenon reserved for Hollywood movies,"" the German scholar said. ""TV series have a very decisive influence on how a society is organized, how truths are constructed, and how people negotiate differing opinions and positions on, for instance, how to deal with pandemics.""Seven women and three men flee the plague to a country house near Florence.

How Hotel F&B Pivoted in Response to COVID-19, and What the Future Holds
COVID-19 has affected the hospitality and tourism industries in a number of ways, and hotel food and beverage operations is one of the most affected areas. A decline in travel, low occupancy rates, and guests shifting to either cooking at home or preferring drive-thru, curbside, and delivery over eating out has led to hotel F&B rapidly evolving and adjusting their models. Hotels are marketing their eateries to locals, offering contactless food delivery, and enhancing gift card sales.

August 12, 2020


By Court Williams














Global tourism has been expanding rapidly over the past few decades, and this was a primary factor driving the hospitality industry before the coronavirus outbreak. Growth projected by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), set the expected number of tourist arrivals across the globe at more than 1.5 billion by 2020.

Covid-19 had other ideas, however, and 2020 has turned out to be the year everything changed. Hotel food and beverage (F&B) operations are among some of the most-affected industries.
Key Hotel F&B Trends Before Covid-19
Change is inevitable, and the whirlwind arrival of Covid-19 proved once again that humanity can't count on a status quo remaining in place indefinitely. Prior to the coronavirus, some of the key factors that were driving the hotel F&B industry included higher disposable income, the shift to the experience economy among Millennials and Gen Z, and the increased use of technology in all areas of hospitality.

Online travel agencies (OTAs), increased digital penetration and a focus on the use of mobile devices have made finding tech-savvy staff a priority, which many hotels struggled with. The industry was under pressure nevertheless to expand online ordering and food delivery services, to satisfy the growing demand for greater convenience in the face of increased urban living and changing social behaviors.
Switching to Innovative Hotel F&B Offerings
The situation has changed. As a result of the coronavirus, hotels all over the world have changed their catering options to allow for drive-through, curbside pick-up, take-out and delivery. Occupancy rates have fallen drastically because of the high risk of travel and the need for social distancing. Most people now choose to connect virtually rather than travel, and many countries still have their borders closed to residents from elsewhere.

People are also doing more of their own cooking. According to a survey report from Hunter, a food and beverage marketing agency, 54% of Americans now do more cooking than they did previously, while 35% say they enjoy it more. If this upward trend continues, it could have major repercussions for the dining-out industry.

Since nothing inspires innovation as well as necessity, hotels globally have pivoted to embrace new ways of providing service for guests. These include contactless methods of booking and payment, ordering meals ahead of arrival, outdoor dining spaces and others.

Here's what some of the leaders in the industry are doing.
1. Contactless Food Delivery Options
Since most governments are prohibiting food and beverage outlets from opening fully for dine-in guests, contactless food delivery options have gained momentum. Not only does this enable customers to avoid in-person contact, it offers greater convenience, less travel time to get to a venue, and the ability to support the local economy. This is effectively resulting in a transition from ""dining in"" to ""dining out,"" and causing hotel F&B outlets to rethink their approach.
2. Sale of Gift Cards and Certificates
Hotel F&B divisions globally have had a tough few months during the pandemic, with forced closures eating away at their reserves and no end to the lockdown in sight. To bridge the gap, many have begun offering gift cards and certificates for purchase, which customers can buy in advance of their next visit. Many of these options are accompanied by a special promotional offer or an attractive discount. This approach helped venues generate revenue during the lockdown, and enabled customers to plan (and spend) ahead of time for when the measures are lifted.
3. Repurposing Premises and Operations     
Instead of allowing well-appointed kitchens and dining areas to operate at a loss, some venues have repurposed their premises to offer innovative new products. Where chef-driven, fine-dining restaurants were previously focused on giving their guests a remarkable dine-in experience while take-out was an afterthought, they are now aiming to deliver the same type of pleasurable experience in customers' homes with critical attention paid to hygiene and safety, packaging and customer-centric online ordering.
4. Promoting ""At Home"" Dining Experiences
Since many restaurants won't be allowed to operate at full capacity even after the pandemic is over, more and more hotel F&B brands are likely to offer ""At Home"" experiences. In Australia, for example, Theodore's family-run snack bar in Melbourne has restyled itself as Ted's Grocer and Bottle-Shop, selling deli and baked goods along with take-home meals. Licensing regulations have been relaxed to allow bars to deliver alcohol to customers' homes, including hand-made cocktails and platters and access to the bar's playlists.
5. Alternative Cuisine Options
Plant-based meats, vegan cuisine and the use of local produce are also seeing a rise in popularity, and there's no shortage of funding options for food tech and alternative protein start-ups. The reported origins of coronavirus at a wet market in Wuhan, China, are making people rethink their reliance on animal-based protein.
6. Environmental Factors
The pandemic has also increased awareness of environmental effects, such as pollution relief resulting from reduced transportation of food and other products. The difficulty the agricultural industry has had to get supplies to end-users has highlighted both the enormity of our consumption and the consequences of a glitch in the supply line.
7. Socially-Distanced Service
Restaurants that have reopened with social distancing measures in place and those that are operating outdoor patio venues only have all adopted different levels of ""safe"" service for customers. Servers typically wear masks and/or face shields. Many use paddle-type objects to place the food on the table from a greater distance.
8. Digital Menus and Self-Service
Some chains have introduced digital ordering from web-based menus or iPads, to reduce the contact between servers and diners. Payments are contactless and restaurant cashiers are protected from customer contact by Plexiglass shields. Some venues are maximizing their use of self-service through technology and robotics, with inventions like Sally the Salad Maker coming into their own.

So, what lies in the future for hotel F&B, as hotel operations evolve into the new normal? What will guests and locals want from restaurants, bars and events?
The Post-Covid Future for the Hotel Industry
As hotels struggle to predict future occupancy levels, staffing requirements, and the cost of newly-minted sanitization protocols, they are also preoccupied with ensuring the safety of both staff and guests. Retraining of staff will include how to avoid physical contact, maintaining the required levels of cleaning supplies and how to respond to a positive Covid-19 result on the premises.

While housekeeping will have the lion's share of the new rules to comply with, hotel management will be required to set up ways to implement Covid screening at check-in, limit elevator use, provide PPE for all staff, and check employee temperatures regularly.
The Impact on Hotel F&B Environments
In the F&B environment, we expect many hotels to replace restaurants with pre-packaged, grab-and-go meals and deliveries from third-party restaurants as their main forms of foodservice. Restaurants, bars and lounges are likely to reopen with limited capacity to ensure social distancing, but will have to be certain of getting enough diners to make it worth their while to do so. Once that happens, they'll have to redraw their floor plans to ensure a minimum of 6 feet between tables.

Buffet operations are especially problematic, so we expect the reopening of these venues to take longer and require more strategy. Most hotels have discontinued their room service operations for the present, and this might well become a permanent situation. Hotels will have to reconfigure their kitchen layouts to create more space between workstations. Menu offerings should be revised to help limit the number of cooks needed in the kitchen at a time, and food costs will likely increase as a result of buying smaller volumes.

In terms of banqueting and events, the business world's shift to virtual meetings and conferences is likely to have a lasting impact on hotel F&B. This, combined with the ongoing restrictions around travel and large gatherings makes it challenging to set a date for the reopening of these facilities at this point. I suspect it will take at least until mid-2021 before we know the answers to all the questions about event management.
The Staffing Conundrum
Before Covid-19 hit, the hospitality industry was in the throes of a major shortage of skilled labor. Where hotel F&B operators were focused on finding the top talent for each position, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of employee support and safety. Apart from the various programs to help laid-off and furloughed workers in the short-term, we've also seen foodservice operations increase the wages of those working to compensate for their risks.

Changes in HR policies that I expect to see cemented in the post-Covid hotel F&B world include an entrepreneurial approach to engaging employees. The short-term labor surplus will make it even more important to find and keep the best staff, and to that end hotels will be looking to invest in improved benefits and perks. Better health care, childcare, free or discounted meals, paid sick leave, and staff discounts will help create a culture in which employees feel valued.

At the same time, hotel F&B departments can expect to be scored more harshly by current and potential employees. Workers will base their evaluation on staff safety and sanitization practices as much as compensation and benefits, and a safe working environment will be crucial for attracting and keeping top employees.
Rethinking Every Aspect
There's no question that Covid-19 has changed our world forever. The only question is how do we make sure we function successfully in the new world? The hospitality industry will have to rethink every aspect of hotel F&B operations, from floor layouts to menu offerings, while also taking environmental impact and corporate culture into account. One thing's for certain-we're in for a challenging ride.

0,YouTuber aims to take down 'mask-holes' with gun that fires surgical mask at your face,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8636687/YouTuber-aims-mask-holes-gun-fires-surgical-mask-face.html,"By Dan Avery For Dailymail.com  Published:  18:34 EST, 17 August 2020   |  Updated:  16:11 EST, 18 August 2020    255View  commentsA preponderance of evidence proves that wearing a mask significantly reduces the chances of spreading COVID-19.But many Americans still refuse to don face coverings in public, as some believe they are ineffective or uncomfortable and others think they can cause carbon dioxide poisoning - while some people are just plain lazy. Enter YouTuber Allen Pan, who has literally weaponized the war on 'mask-holes' with a gun that launches a surgical mask at a target's face.The mask gun was built using a CO2 canister, part of a car's break line and the pistol grip of a spary paint can as the trigger.After the first attempt of shooting a mask onto a mannequin, the innovation proved to be 100 percent successful.YouTuber Allen Pan Pan built a gun that fires a surgical mask to take down anti-maskers. He hooked up a C02 solenoid valve (pictured) to part of a car's brake line and used the pistol grip from a pray paint can as his trigger. Small weighted magnets on the corner of the mask give it heft and help it wrap around a target's facePan, posted a video about his invention on his YouTube channel, Sufficiently Advanced, which has more than a million subscribers.'There are so many smart people who have made so many videos about how masks are safe and effective,' Pan said, 'If that works, it would've worked by now.' Instead, the 30-year-old said, he was going to focus on 'the one thing coronavirus protestors actually seem to care about, the Second Amendment.''An American problem,' he added, 'demands an American solution.' Pan has more than a million subscribers on his YouTube channel, Sufficiently Advanced. His gun worked perfectly the first time he fired it, but subsequent attempts were a bit wide of the markAfter mixed results with a mannequin's head, Pan tried his mask gun on himself. He was able to launch the mask onto his nose and mouth without causing any bodily harmPan built his jerry-rigged shooter by hooking up a C02 canister to a solenoid and part of a car's brake line. He used the pistol grip from a can of spray paint as his trigger.Small weighted magnets on strings tied to the corner of the mask give it some heft and help it wrap around a victim's face.Amazingly Pan's first attempt - on a mannequin head - was 100 percent successful.Even with a green laser scope, though, subsequent tries were less so. They either left the dummy's nose uncovered or went completely wide of the mark.After one misfire resulted in the dummy's neck being 'strangled,' Pan declared 'We're ready for human trials!'He used himself as a guinea pig, successfully covering his nose and mouth without causing any bodily harm.Then then took his device to Huntington Beach, a conservative slice of Southern California that's held numerous pro-Trump rallies.Pan brought his invention to Huntington Beach and let some locals. test it out. Pan's mask gun isn't quite ready for mass production, but it's certainly an entertaining way to engage people about public health during this trying timeAccording to Pan, only about one in four people were wearing masks when he got to the beach.'I fully expect people to get angry at me,' Pan said in the video. 'I even brought my running shoes in case things got, y'know, racist.'Instead, he found volunteers interested in testing out his 'alien, sci-fi alt-history steampunk' weapon. Pan is no newcomer to ingenious inventions: He graduated from the University of Southern California in 2012 with a B.S. in electrical engineering. Since then he's built a working lightsaber, recreated Spider-Man's web spinners and turned a treadmill into a PS4 controller. In 2017, he was a contestant on MythBusters: The Search, and competed for on the chance to host a reboot of the popular Discovery Channel series.Pan's mask gun isn't quite ready for mass production, but it's certainly an entertaining way to engage people about public health during a trying time.

      Biden's COVID chief says the US should go into a total national lockdown for six WEEKS to avoid 'virus hell' and the federal government can borrow to pay workers while country is shutdown

0,New Accenture study reveals emerging trends in digital health,https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/new-accenture-study-reveals-emerging-trends-digital-health,"Healthcare organizations must become more collaborative with patients, employees, partners and the public when creating digital innovations to have success in the future, according to research from Accenture.The professional services company released its ""Digital Health Technology Vision 2020"" report that identified five trends that emerged before the COVID-19 pandemic, but that have only accelerated because of it.The trends relate to digital patient experience, artificial intelligence, smart devices, robots and innovation.TOP-LINE DATAThe pandemic has turned digital technology into a lifeline for many. It has become the way people receive healthcare, get information about the virus, and stay in touch with family and friends. It's also become the way people entertain themselves during the lockdown.The survey found that 85% of health executives believe that technology has become an inextricable part of life, and 70% of global consumers expect it to become an even bigger part of their lives in the next three years.When it comes to the future of patient engagement, 90% of health executives believe organizations need to elevate their relationships with customers and partners if they hope to compete.“People today expect more from their digital experiences,” the authors wrote in the report. “They want to feel important and as if the healthcare organization recognizes and takes notice of them. Gone are the days of mass services and black box personalization.”The report says that organizations can set themselves up for future success by customizing the consumer experience and by giving consumers agency over their health decisions.The future of AI is already in the works, with 69% of healthcare organizations saying they are piloting or adopting it. They can use AI by plugging it into existing workflows to automate processes, to screen and triage patients using chatbots, and to reconfigure supply chains, among other things.To be successful when it comes to AI, healthcare organizations must work with AI, instead of simply automating the workflow, according to the report. This collaboration can be done through advancements in natural language processing to help people and machines better work together.“Providers and payers that facilitate human-machine collaboration today will be able to reimagine every aspect of their organization, from the way they care for patients to the way they hire and train employees,” the report says. “True pioneers will use these capabilities to reinvent care delivery.”Smart devices have become a more prominent presence as people invite them into their lives to help fight the COVID-19 virus and to share health data with their doctors. However, the study argues, while people do benefit from technology, people are concerned about how their data is used. Seventy percent of healthcare consumers surveyed said they are concerned about data privacy and commercial tracking associated with their online activities, behaviors, location and interests.To combat that concern, the report suggests that healthcare organizations must ensure that their operating models are equipped to handle the ownership of consumer data. It also says that innovators must get comfortable releasing products that may seem unfinished at the time with the intention of transforming over time.COVID-19 has moved robots out of the warehouse and into the healthcare system, according to the report. More than 70% of health executives said that robotics will enable the next generation of services in the physical world.With the growing number of robots in the health sector, the report says that organizations must integrate them into the workforce in a way that produces trust with existing staff. The report found that 54% of health executives say their employees will be challenged to figure out how to work with robots.“A proper introduction matters when it comes to bringing robots into healthcare settings,” the report says. “Gauge the sentiment, attitudes and fears of employees and consumers alike – and adapt accordingly.”With 78% of the healthcare executives saying they believe that the stakes for innovation have never been higher, the report notes that “getting it right” will require new ways of innovating with ecosystem partners and third-party organizations.“COVID-19 has not slowed digital technology innovation; rather, it’s amplifying it to historic levels,” said Dr. Kaveh Safavi, a senior managing director in Accenture’s Health practice and an author of the report, in a statement. “Given the current environment, healthcare organizations must elevate their technology agenda to explore emerging digital technologies that provide the right infrastructure to help people feel safer about using technology tools for their healthcare experience.”HOW IT WAS DONEThis report was derived from Accenture’s annual Tech Vision 2020 report, which predicts trends likely to disrupt business in the near future.The research team gathered input from Technology Vision External Advisory Board and conducted interviews with industry experts. It also conducted an online survey of over 6,000 business and IT executives from 25 different countries. The survey took responses from November 2019 to January 2020.At the same time, the company surveyed 2,000 people in the U.S., U.K., China and India, with respondents representing different age and demographic groups, to understand the use and role of technology in people’s lives.THE LARGER TRENDThe idea that the technological innovations that came out of the COVID-19 pandemic are here to stay is not new.Over the course of the pandemic, technology has been adapted to track, test and treat the virus. New advancements in digital therapeutics, online training, at-home testing and more have come onto the market recently. ON THE RECORD“The intersection between digital technology and healthcare experiences has certainly accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and leading the future of care will demand rethinking core assumptions about the intersection of people and technology,” Safavi said. “People’s perceptions of and relationships with technology are changing, and to adapt, healthcare payers and providers need to redesign digital experiences.” Credit: PopitMobiHealthNews:The latest news in digital health delivered daily to your inbox.Credit: Popit© 2020 MobiHealthNews is a publication of HIMSS MediaMobiHealthNews:The latest news in digital health delivered daily to your inbox.Credit: PopitCredit: NUS"

2nd Quarter 2020 Company Highlights

Financial Outlook 

Subject to the key assumptions below, the Company expects adjusted net income for 2020 to be in a range of $1.00 to $1.201 per share. The Company also continues to believe that it remains positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2021.

Key assumptions supporting the Company’s 2020 adjusted net income per share guidance:

1. On a continuing operations basis.

Although the Company does provide guidance for adjusted net income per share (which is a non-GAAP financial measure), it is not able to forecast the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP without unreasonable effort. Certain elements of the composition of the GAAP amount are not predictable, making it impracticable for the Company to forecast. Such elements include, but are not limited to restructuring and acquisition charges. As a result, no GAAP guidance or reconciliation of the Company’s adjusted net income per share guidance is provided. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially significant impact on its future GAAP financial results. The outlook is based on certain assumptions that are subject to the risk factors discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Dividend Information 

The Board of Directors approved a third quarter 2020 dividend payment of $0.0025 per share, payable on September 30, 2020, to shareholders of record as of September 15, 2020.

GAAP/Non-GAAP Reconciliations (unaudited), continued

The following items have been excluded in our non-GAAP financial measures:

(1) Intangible amortization includes amortization of intangible assets established during purchase accounting for business combinations. These amounts are highly dependent on the size and frequency of acquisitions and are being excluded to allow for a more consistent comparison with forecasted, current and historical results and the results of our peers.

(2) Acquisition-related charges were $3.9 million and $8.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $3.7 million and $7.8 million for the same periods of 2019. Acquisition-related charges in 2020 and 2019 consist primarily of transition costs for the Halyard acquisition. Exit and realignment charges were $2.2 million and $4.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $1.7 million and $2.4 million for the same periods of 2019. Exit and realignment charges in 2020 were associated with severance from reduction in force and other costs related to the reorganization of the U.S. commercial, operations and executive teams. Exit and realignment charges in 2019 were associated with severance costs, the establishment of our client engagement center, and IT restructuring charges.

(3) Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation costs were associated with significant global IT platforms in connection with the redesign of our global information system strategy.

(4) Other includes interest costs and net actuarial losses related to the U.S. Retirement Plan of $0.6 million and $1.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, and gain from the surrender of company-owned life insurance policies of $(3.5) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. Other includes interest costs and net actuarial losses related to the U.S. Retirement Plan for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.

(5) (Gain) loss on extinguishment and modification of debt in 2020 includes the write-off of deferred financing costs of $0.3 million and $2.4 million and third party fees of $0.8 million and $3.0 million, which was offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the partial repurchase of our 2021 and 2024 Notes of $(2.9) million and $(3.1) million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. (Gain) loss on extinguishment and modification of debt in 2019 includes the write-off of deferred financing costs.

(6) Includes a tax adjustment associated with the estimated benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

(7) These charges have been tax effected in the preceding table by determining the income tax rate depending on the amount of charges incurred in different tax jurisdictions and the deductibility of those charges for income tax purposes.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). In general, the measures exclude items and charges that (i) management does not believe reflect Owens & Minor, Inc.'s (the ""Company"") core business and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation.

Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on its financial and operating results and in comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.

0,Epic EHR-linked telehealth skyrockets at Children’s Colorado,https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/epic-ehr-linked-telehealth-skyrockets-children-s-colorado,"Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora.Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora developed an active and growing telemedicine program over the past eight years. Telemedicine has been particularly important because of the large, multistate service region with many rural and frontier patients, mountain passes and snow that complicate travel, and limited numbers of pediatric subspecialists in the Rocky Mountain region outside of Denver.THE PROBLEMBefore COVID-19, almost all specialties were using telemedicine in some aspect of their practice. However, use was sporadic, spanned a wide variety of use-cases, and there was not a great deal of depth in each specialty.The limitations in use were primarily due to the same barriers stated by most entities – worries about reimbursement policy, multistate licensure and credentialing issues, and concerns about telemedicine’s relative value compared to traditional in-person models.Children’s Hospital’s telemedicine platform vendor has been Vidyo, and the platform was integrated with the organization’s Epic electronic health record. The organization also uses a custom-developed, HIPAA-compliant photo-sharing platform.PROPOSAL“COVID-19 hit Colorado early with a substantial number of cases and an associated marked limitation of in-person care by mid-March, necessitating an exponential rapid expansion of telehealth and redesign of care delivery that impacted each and every aspect of our operations,” said Dr. Christina Olson, telehealth medical director at Children’s Hospital Colorado. “We set out to make this change in three phases with a range of services and creative solutions occurring in each.”Phase One was mobilization, ramping up telehealth services quickly to meet patient and family needs.Dr. Christina Olson, Children’s Hospital Colorado“We overhauled our telehealth training and onboarding effort to ensure provider acceptance, knowledge and compliance with best practice standards for tele-enabled practice, and made it fully online/on-demand to reach more than 1,000 clinicians over three weeks,” Olson explained.“Given the necessity to immediately convert more than 90% of ambulatory care from in-person to virtual, leverage staff resources across several campuses and add video capability to our ED and inpatient rooms, we significantly increased the number of licenses for our Vidyo telemedicine platform, and upgraded our server and hardware infrastructure capacity.”Further, the healthcare organization adapted its hospital space and added the technology and processes to safely replace in-person care with home-based care, both for patients and by providers, she added. Staff collaborated with primary care partners to train as many as possible on the integration of telemedicine into their workplaces.Phase Two was mitigation, stabilizing the delivery of care and mitigating the risks and effects of COVID-19 on team members, patients and families.“We expanded the use of telemedicine in the emergency department and inpatient care spaces to limit the spread of infection, reduce use of PPE and promote safety of our workforce,” said John F. “Fred” Thomas, director of telehealth services at Children’s Hospital Colorado. “Process improvement, data analytics and project management resources were allocated to telehealth to facilitate efficient resource utilization and growth following the initial rapid expansion phase.”Additionally, the organization is continuing to expand the home-based care model and is adding monitoring of chronic illnesses in vulnerable populations, Thomas said.John F. “Fred” Thomas, Children’s Hospital ColoradoPhase Three was the optimization of telehealth as in-person visits return.“We are providing ongoing support of telehealth to augment in-person ambulatory visits as we reestablish in-person care in a socially distanced manner, and as our operating rooms and procedure center increase operating hours to accept pent-up demand of elective visits and procedures delayed due to the pandemic,” Thomas explained.“We are expanding our telemedicine platform capacities to our primary care network of providers and to regional care alliances across the rural states of Montana, Wyoming and New Mexico to streamline communication across partners, patients and specialists.”MARKETPLACEThere are many vendors of telemedicine technology and services on the health IT market today. Healthcare IT News recently compiled a comprehensive list of these vendors with detailed descriptions. To read this special report, click here.MEETING THE CHALLENGEEarly on, Children’s Hospital realized that how it dealt with this crisis would be critical from public health, organizational, team-member and community-provider perspectives. So, once the governor of Colorado issued a statewide stay-at-home order, staff members were initiating efforts to overhaul practice models to ensure safe provision of care for our vulnerable patients.“Through a well-designed and coordinated effort of hundreds of people spanning the organization, multiple planning teams were organized to strategize and operationalize plans for near every operation in the hospital, including, but not limited to, clinical teams, IT, clinical informaticists and therapy services,” Olson noted. “Prior to COVID-19, thousands of clinicians and administrative staff had had no experience with telemedicine.”The engagement of these teams supplanted and enhanced the efforts possible by the relatively small telemedicine team, she added. With many more fresh eyes, staff have been able to accomplish a great deal of growth and integration of operational improvements that would have taken much longer without the need to improvise quickly because of the pandemic, she said.“In the first six business days of April 2020, Children’s Colorado providers completed more than 5,000 telehealth visits,” Thomas recalled. “That’s roughly equal to the number of telehealth visits that had been completed for all of 2019. We also accomplished in two months what had ultimately been most of our five-year plan for instituting practice change.”This included:RESULTSChildren’s Colorado is the only quaternary children’s hospital in the Rocky Mountain region, serving as a hospital for children with severe acute and chronic diseases from Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, western Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, along with other states.“Many rural areas have limited resources and access to care under normal circumstances,” Olson explained.“With travel severely restricted, yet care needs for these medically fragile patients remaining, we were able to reduce travel and economic burden [and] potential stress on local intervening adult-focused health systems, and continue to serve children and families without skipping a beat. We were able to expand to meet the demand, supporting a 5,500% growth in telehealth visits in less than one month.”The organization was able to incorporate telemedicine care models to maintain parallel ambulatory visits simultaneously with the reestablishment of in-person care once the stay-at-home orders were ended. These operational changes allowed for conservation of critical PPE and promotion of physical distancing in clinics and facilities, resulting in protecting patients, families, providers and staff from potential infection.“As our hospital has returned to more normal operations, our system is much better prepared to address a potential reemergence of COVID-19, if it occurs as numerous models predict,” Thomas said. “Additionally, it has allowed us to evaluate a right-sizing of our telemedicine capacities and a thorough evaluation of right-fit for proportion of telemedicine and in-person visits.”There are numerous metrics of success, Thomas noted; a few noteworthy highlights include:USING FCC AWARD FUNDSEarlier this year, Children’s Hospital was awarded $807,090 by the FCC to implement telehealth services to provide continuity of medical care for children, adolescents and young adults with complex pediatric illnesses in the Rocky Mountain region.“COVID-19 has become the catalyst that intensified the existing fragile relationship between the healthcare ecosystem and at-risk populations, like the vulnerable children, adolescents and young adults treated by Children’s Colorado,” Thomas said. “Previously, while aspects of their care might have incorporated some aspect of tele-enabled care, for the most part, these vulnerable patients had to travel to our main hospital location in Aurora, Colorado, to receive care.”This need to travel was a potential gap for some of the most vulnerable, economically disadvantaged patients; however, this pandemic has escalated the need to assure our vulnerable populations experience continuity of their medical care and not be at risk of exposure to this potentially deadly virus, he added.What’s more, the disruption also has presented an opportunity for a change in the model of care: The FCC grant allowed the organization to escalate its plans for an overall integration of telemedicine, said Thomas.Twitter: @SiwickiHealthIT

0,Republican convention: Who is speaking and what to expect,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-24/republican-convention-what-to-expect,"Last week, Democrats made history, putting on the country’s first virtual national convention. This week, Republicans will try to one-up them. As recent weeks have shown, the GOP has taken a completely different approach to planning its event. The Republican National Convention will have more live events and delegates meeting in person. And GOP officials argue that the Democratic event was bleak — with speakers lambasting Trump’s leadership as the country faces a pandemic, economic meltdown and racial injustices — and that theirs will be more positive. “The RNC Convention will be four days of lifting up the stories of everyday Americans who have been empowered thanks to President Trump’s policies and record of fighting for them,” Republican National Committee press secretary Mandi Merritt said in a statement. “While the DNC has focused on division and negativity, the RNC will honor what makes our country great and celebrate four more years of historic progress under President Trump.”But it’s likely that Trump’s own portrayal of the country he leads will continue to be exceedingly dark. He has focused recently on protests and violence in American cities and presented himself as the last defense against an aggressive China and a lonely ally of law enforcement, while offering a foreboding caricature of an America certain to descend into “total anarchy” if Joe Biden is elected.And unlike the Democratic convention last week, Republicans will be competing for the nation’s attention as two hurricanes are expected to make landfall along the Gulf Coast, one Monday and another just days later. The overall theme for the convention is “Honoring the Great American Story.” First Lady Melania Trump will speak Tuesday from the White House Rose Garden, whose redesign she recently oversaw; Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday from Ft. McHenry in Baltimore and President Trump on Thursday from the White House. The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington will also serve as a hub for speeches.

Trump is ‘hijacking’ White House events for ‘partisan, political’ gain, experts say
Trump and his aides have long ignored ethics norms, and the president is escalating his use of official events to attack Joe Biden and Democrats. The Republican convention’s main event will start “around” 5:30 Pacific each night and run until 8 p.m., GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniels has said. Viewers can stream the convention on Amazon Prime Video, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Twitch or watch it on TV on AT&T U-Verse or DirecTV.Here’s what to watch for this week:On the last night of the Democratic convention, Biden said Trump “has cloaked America in darkness.” The former vice president promised: “If you entrust me with the presidency I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness.” Republican officials criticized the Democrats’ convention as too negative. “Over the last week, the Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history,” Trump said Friday in a speech at the conservative Council of National Policy in Arlington, Va. “They spent four straight days attacking America as racist, a horrible country that must be redeemed.”The GOP event will be “more aspirational, less grim, less attacking,” McDaniel said last week on Fox News. The question is whether Trump can sell himself as a hopeful, positive figure when much of his campaign has been rooted in negative attacks directed at his political opponents, the media, racial justice protesters and his critics. The president plans to break from convention tradition and speak on all four nights — in the 10 p.m. hour, the only hour carried by all broadcast networks. Following four nights of nationally televised attacks on his presidency last week, Trump “has a lot to say,” according to a person familiar with the convention program.

Coronavirus overshadows Trump’s legacy in office

Coronavirus overshadows Trump’s legacy in office
Win or lose in November, President Trump already has a legacy of domestic deregulation and global disruption. But his botched response to a deadly pandemic and a deep recession overshadow the rest. Can Republicans outdo the Democrats?
Trump’s campaign and the RNC have two advantages: going second and being able to learn from the DNC’s programming, and leveraging the trappings of the presidency. Rather than speaking in a cavernous, empty room, Trump will accept the nomination on the South Lawn of the White House, with the columns and Truman Balcony bathed in light, a live audience of some size fanned out before him and a dramatic fireworks display on the National Mall at the end. There is, however, some concern over the president’s recent directive that the speeches be delivered live, making the production more complicated technically. Trump had seized on the fact that Michelle Obama’s remarks were taped ahead of the convention and is intent on shielding his own convention speakers from whatever criticism could come from doing the same.The last-minute nature of the planning also led to a slow release of details on the event. By the Friday before their convention, Democrats had announced two hours of programming each night and published a speaking schedule. Republicans did not announce their speaking schedule until Sunday. (Major networks have announced plans to allot one hour of prime-time coverage to the convention, just as they did with the Democratic convention.) Trump’s acceptance speech, like the rest of the convention, was originally set for Charlotte, N.C., but moved briefly to Jacksonville, Fla., when officials in the Sunshine State were initially more welcoming of a large in-person event. That plan was scrapped as coronavirus cases spiked in Florida; the official business portion of the convention, now in a limited capacity, will remain in Charlotte.

Trump vs. Biden: Comparing their policies on race, immigration, climate and more
A look at where President Trump and Joe Biden stand on key issues in the 2020 election, including healthcare, immigration, police reform and climate.Who is (and isn’t) scheduled to speak?
Trump’s convention lineup is bulldozing several political norms. Not only are he and the first lady scheduled to speak from the White House, which is not supposed to be used for overtly political events, the inclusion of several administration officials — counselor Kellyanne Conway, senior advisor Ivanka Trump, director of social media Dan Scavino and domestic policy advisor Ja’Ron Smith will all speak — obliterates any pretense of keeping the business of government separate from politics. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo plans to speak to an RNC audience while on an official mission in Israel, flouting the longstanding tradition for those serving as the nation’s top diplomat of avoiding partisan politics.The convention will also feature a mix of Republican rising stars and individuals who have either benefited from the president’s policies or can amplify conservative criticisms. As he did four years ago as an outsider, Trump plans to harness grievances against his adversaries.Nick Sandmann, the former Covington Catholic student who won settlements from two news outlets over their coverage of his 2019 encounter with a Native American protester, will speak about what he sees as anti-conservative media bias. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who brandished their guns at Black Lives Matter protesters outside their mansion this summer, will give voice to what they feel is an assault by Democrats on the 2nd Amendment and law enforcement.Republicans also plan to feature others to highlight the benefits of Trump’s main achievements, including tax reform, criminal justice reform, regulatory rollbacks, PPP loans and tougher policies restricting illegal immigration and limiting asylum claims. The speakers include:Monday: Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina; Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Jim Jordan of Ohio; former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley; Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend and Trump campaign fundraiser, Kimberly Guilfoyle; Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk; Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, died in a 2018 Florida school shooting; Montana business owner Tanya Weinreis; and the McCloskeys. Tuesday: First Lady Melania Trump; President Trump’s grown children Eric and Tiffany; Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky; Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds; former Florida Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi; anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson; Pompeo; and Sandmann.Wednesday: Vice President Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence; Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Texas and Joni Ernst of Iowa; South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem; Reps. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin of New York; former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell; Trump campaign advisor and daughter-in-law Lara Trump; Michael McHale, president of the National Assn. of Police Organizations; former NFL players Burgess Owens and Jack Brewer; and Conway.Thursday: President Trump; Housing Secretary Ben Carson; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California; Ivanka Trump; former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; evangelical leader Franklin Graham; Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White; Alice Johnson, a nonviolent drug offender whose sentence was commuted by Trump; and Carl and Marsha Mueller, whose aid worker daughter Kayla was killed by Islamic State. Trump’s acceptance speech
Leading up to and throughout the Democratic convention, Trump and his campaign aides attempted to convince voters that Biden was doddering and diminished. But they only succeeded in lowering expectations that Biden easily surpassed with his speech. Biden’s team has attacked Trump’s record, not his litany of gaffes in recent weeks as he struggled to read prepared remarks from the teleprompter (most notably his pronunciation of Yosemite as “Yo-semites” and Thailand as “Thigh-land), but there is no guarantee that Trump, who plans to appear live on multiple nights, will speak as clearly during his address as Biden did.There’s also the question of how the president will adapt his outsider message of grievance and ending “American carnage” now that he is the incumbent. One element that may help give credence to his claims that, despite being the president, he remains an anti-establishment figure is the relative scarcity of prominent Republicans scheduled to share the convention stage. Unlike Biden, who had three former presidents make the case for him, Trump will not feature the only living former Republican president, George W. Bush, who has been coy about whether he’ll back the president or his Democratic challenger.Will the Democratic counterprogramming matter?
The Democratic National Committee and Biden campaign on Friday announced plans for counter-programming to the GOP convention, built around an effort to portray Trump’s tenure as the “Chaos Presidency.”

Coronavirus overshadows Trump’s legacy in office
Win or lose in November, President Trump already has a legacy of domestic deregulation and global disruption. But his botched response to a deadly pandemic and a deep recession overshadow the rest. Each day of the convention, Democrats will air broadcast and digital ads and host video news briefings to spotlight problems with healthcare, the economy and other crises that they say Trump has created or made worse. Speakers will include House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind.The intention is to draw a contrast between Trump and Biden that will be “a preview of the next 75 days,” said Biden campaign advisor Symone Sanders.The Biden campaign has not, however, announced any post-convention events to spotlight their ticket — a departure from the traditional, pre-COVID strategy of following a convention with a barnstorming tour on the campaign trail. Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, granted ABC their first joint television interview, which aired Sunday.John reported from Los Angeles and Stokols from Washington.

0,"DermTech, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200805005918/en/DermTech-Reports-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results-Corporate,"LA JOLLA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DermTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: DMTK) (“DermTech” or the “Company”), a leader in precision dermatology enabled by a non-invasive skin genomics platform, today reported business and unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and also provided a corporate update.

Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results

“Sales execution for the DermTech Pigmented Lesion Assay (“DermTech PLA”) was going very well prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Billable sample volumes were significantly reduced in April, but have rebounded nicely in recent months and, in July 2020, they recovered to pre-pandemic levels despite the fact that dermatology offices have not fully reopened and continue to be affected by the resurgence of the virus,” said John Dobak, M.D., chief executive officer of DermTech. “While early detection of melanoma is critical, and delays can have serious and even deadly consequences, the pandemic caused and could continue to cause a disruption in clinician office visits for assessing suspicious moles. In spite of the challenging macroenvironment, I’m pleased that we have made significant progress on building a foundational commercial infrastructure by growing our sales team, building a digital/telemedicine marketing channel, transitioning to a larger commercial laboratory, and progressing our product pipeline.”

Second Quarter 2020 Review and Corporate Update

DermTech is now poised to capture the promising market opportunity in skin cancer, barring any additional significant effects related to the pandemic. We will continue to focus on commercial payer access that will allow us to better monetize our growing billable sample volumes so that our revenues reflect the progress we are making with clinician utilization of the DermTech PLA. We are also looking forward to the introduction of the DermTech PLA plus, our next generation product for enhanced early melanoma detection with better performance, which we believe could catalyze a faster adoption rate. We are pleased with the June and July 2020 recovery and are providing some metrics to better describe recent trends, but note that we do not expect various performance metrics to recover in a linear fashion and are likely to continue to see fluctuations in these metrics as the pandemic’s impact continues and as various cities and offices change COVID-19 related restrictions. These metrics will not necessarily be updated in the future.

Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results

Assay revenue increased 128% to $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $0.3 million for the same period of 2019. Assay revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2020 increased due to higher billable sample volume and revenue recognition of Medicare samples related to the final local coverage determination effective February 10, 2020, compared to the same period of 2019. Contract revenue decreased 41% to $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $0.3 million for the same period of 2019. Contract revenue can be highly variable as it is dependent on the pharmaceutical customers’ clinical trial progress, which can be difficult to forecast due to variability of patient enrollment, drug safety and efficacy and other factors. Total revenues increased 38% to $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2019.

Gross loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was 71%, compared to 12% for the same period of 2019. The increase in gross loss was largely driven by higher fixed costs from facilities, equipment and increased headcount to increase testing capacity. In addition, gross loss was negatively affected by the decrease in the Company’s contract revenue and the negative effects from COVID-19 on the Company’s assay revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Assay gross loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was 118%.

Sales and marketing expense increased 233% to $3.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $1.0 million for the same period of 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to sales force expansion to drive the adoption of the DermTech PLA and additional marketing investment to increase awareness of the DermTech PLA as a non-invasive genomic based diagnostic for melanoma.

Research and development expense increased 67% to $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $0.5 million for the same period of 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher compensation costs related to expanding the research and development team as well as increased spend on laboratory supplies.

General and administrative expense increased 166% to $4.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $1.7 million for the same period of 2019. The increase was primarily due to additional public company costs, including higher legal costs related to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, higher compensation costs from expanding the general and administrative team, higher insurance costs, and a $1.0 million litigation settlement charge.

Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $9.4 million, which included $1.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, compared to a net loss of $3.7 million for the same period of 2019, which included $0.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $61.1 million as of June 30, 2020.

Update on COVID-19 Impact 

During the second quarter of 2020, we continued our broad COVID-19 response to drive education and usage despite reduced patient office visits and in-person sales calls. We are now seeing dermatology offices reopen, although this is highly dependent upon COVID-19 infection rates within various geographic areas. A large portion of our revenue is attributable to sales in states such as Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas, and we will be closely monitoring developments there. We expect that reopened dermatology practices may focus initially on essential and time-sensitive dermatology care needs, such as skin cancer assessment, though it is not clear how this will impact our sample volumes.

Our lab remains fully operational and is receiving and analyzing samples as they are collected. In response to the closure of dermatology offices, our sales team has been conducting virtual sales calls and providing client education. We have also introduced a telemedicine option for remote, clinician-guided sample collection by the patient for the DermTech PLA test, which may be important should additional stay-at-home orders or other restrictions occur.

While we cannot predict which states will remain open or will reopen, as noted above, we did see some encouraging data over the last quarter which underscores clinician acceptance of the DermTech PLA and gives us confidence that, in a normalized environment and barring COVID-19 interruptions, we would expect to see strong growth trends.

We have not furloughed or terminated any employees as a result of the COVID-19 related slowdown, nor have we received any federal Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. Additional increases in headcount and spending associated with higher sample volumes and improving internal capabilities were delayed, but those efforts have resumed as we have started to recover from the pandemic. We expect to continue our originally planned expenditures for research and development and for infrastructure enhancements, including capital equipment.

On one hand the healthcare systems globally have been struggling to manage the COVID-19 patient population and the researchers are racing to find a solution to this problem; on the other hand, the economic impacts are felt across other sectors. The slowdown in the end-market demand is exerting tremendous pressure on the healthcare operations which has led to adoption of technologies that can help in easing the pressures. Download Free Sample Report Now @ https://www.meticulousresearch.com/download-sample-report/cp_id=3995The overall healthcare analytics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 26% from 2020 to reach $84.2 billion by 2027. The growth in the healthcare analytics market is majorly propelled by growing demand for population health management, changing healthcare dynamics amidst COVID-19, need for redesigned EHR with advanced analytics capabilities, focus on e-health collaborations, investments by venture capitalists, increasing pressure to provide quality care and control healthcare costs, and rise in adoption of big data in healthcare industry.Analytics to Support Resourcing, Operational and Financial Decision Making Amidst COVID-19Some of the major changes being witnessed by healthcare industry are rise in adoption of solutions including patient engagement, population health management, remote patient monitoring, artificial intelligence (AI), telemedicine, and advanced analytics, among others. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the criticality of population health management and need for accurate, up-to-date patient information to guide decision-making. Data analytics forms a crux of most of these solutions which has resulted in growing investment by healthcare providers and payers in adoption of solutions based on advanced analytics capabilities. For instance, in June 2020, Verily and CVS Health launched an app called Healthy at Work that incorporates local, onsite and mail testing services into a centralized digital analytics dashboard. The app records daily symptoms or disease exposure as shared by employee on the app. Based on the inputs, the app advises the employees whether or not to come to work.Speak to our Analysts to Understand the Impact of COVID-19 on Your Business: https://www.meticulousresearch.com/speak-to-analyst/cp_id=3995Population Health and Analytics, a Win-Win Combination for Targeted Health Intervention for COVID-19Population Health Management (PHM) relies on data to identify the populations and the needs for care, to measure the care provided to these populations, and to help deliver the right care to the right people. As per British Medical Journal, a population health strategy, which primarily targets the elderly, can be applicable for COVID-19 health analysis. As a result, industry players have been offering PHM solutions specifically targeted at COVID-19. For instance, In June 2020, Arcadia (a population health management firm) launched a population health toolkit for COVID-19. The tool supports business continuity decisions for its Accountable Care Organization (ACO) customer. PHM involves use of various solutions such as data integration, visualization, and analytics. Thus, growing focus on PHM to combat COVID-19 directly triggers demand for analytics capabilities.COVID-19 Exposed the EMR Limitations Triggering Need for Improved Data Accuracy and Analytics CapabilitiesThe governments across the globe are focusing on implementing solutions that aid delivery of quality care and EHR/EMR adoption has been a significant part of the initiative. While EHRs have been efficient in keeping records of patient data, the usability of data has been one of the key limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposed these limitations including user interface issues, usability issues, low quality of data, limited data to support drug discovery and research goals, interoperability issues, among others. This has created a need for EHR redesign that can effectively deal with pandemics. Focus areas for overhauled EHR include in-built library of care plans that are based on patient circumstance and preferences, algorithms to deliver personalize care programs, decision support and workflows for rapid and seamless care delivery, interoperability of data, advanced analytics capabilities for patients, providers, and population.eHealth Collaborations Driven by COVID-19 to Leverage Analytics SolutionsThe eHealth collaborations are organizations or government initiatives focused on helping clinical practices to implement business transformation changes and programs including implementation of next-gen technologies and solutions (including healthcare analytics). Industry players have been collaborating or investing in such organizations. For instance, in April 2020, IMAT Solutions (U.S.) announced collaboration with Reliance eHealth Collaborative (U.S.) to develop wide range of use cases for COVID-19 response based on data management, analytics, and reporting solutions by IMAT.Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics, the Solution Providers for COVID-19COVID-19 pandemic has created a wave of predictive analytics tools which is expected to be a major driving force for predictive analytics market in near future. Some of the recent use cases include determination of operational requirements of care providers dealing with COVID-19, predicting possibility of recovery in COVID-19 patients, among others. For instance, in April 2020, Cleveland Clinic (U.S.) in partnership with SAS created a COVID-19 predictive analytics models that help forecast patient volume, bed capacity, ventilator availability, and other metrics. Similarly, in May 2020, researchers at New York University announced an experimental AI tool that makes use of predictive analytics to predict which mildly ill patients with COVID-19 were likely become severely ill. In addition, prescriptive analytics tools have the potential to assist in highlighting strengths, weaknesses and opportunities in treatment methods and prescribe better business practices which has propelled prescriptive solutions keeping COVID-19 in mind. In June 2020, Pivot Point Consulting (U.S. based healthcare IT consulting firm) collaborated with Jvion (provider of clinical-AI prescriptive analytics) to develop back to work solutions applicable for COVID-19 situation using Jvion's clinical-AI CORE that identifies patients with greatest risk.The COVID-19 Analytics Dashboards – An Opportunity to Highlight Analytics OfferingTo help the providers, payers, and other stakeholders to remain up to date on information related to COVID-19 and accelerate decision-making, the industry players have launched a number of analytics dashboards as well as services. For instance, in April 2020, MedeAnalytics rolled out interactive COVID-19 analytics dashboards for its clients aimed at better understanding and management of financial and operational resources. Similarly, in April 2020, Tableau launched COVID-19 Data Hub, a resource for accessing and analyzing the latest data on the novel coronavirus obtained from data sources including Johns Hopkins University, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO).Quick Buy – Healthcare Analytics Market Research Report: https://www.meticulousresearch.com/buy_now.php?pformat=80&vformat=253 Industry Collaborations to Support COVID-19 Situation Using Analytics CapabilitiesThe solution providers are also collaborating to combine their offerings and expertise that can aid the healthcare industry in dealing with the pandemic. In April 2020, SAP in collaboration with EY and Qualtrics announced its plan to provide resources to governments around the world dealing with COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, in May 2020, UnitedHealth in collaboration with Microsoft launched ProtectWell protocol and app that supports return-to-workplace planning (based on CDC guidelines) and COVID-19 symptom screening. The solution combines UnitedHealth Group's clinical and data analytics capabilities with Microsoft's technologies including Microsoft Azure.U.S., the Most Affected Nation With COVID-19 to Provide Significant Demand for AnalyticsThe U.S. is the most affected nation in terms of COVID-19 cases and death. The pandemic has triggered number of analytics projects, launch of new analytics-based offerings, and collaborations specific to the U.S. market. For instance, in June 2020, Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation (PCCI) developed a big data analytics dashboard to accurately identify communities at high risk for COVID-19 infection in the U.S. The dashboard has a Vulnerability Index to determine communities at risk by analyzing comorbidity rates, age, lack of access to food, medicines, among others. Considering the growth opportunities in this market, a number of venture capitalists are increasingly investing in the U.S. healthcare analytics market. For instance, in June 2020, Fincasa Ventures (UAE) invested USD 50 million into MediSponsor, a U.S. based firm offering integrated healthcare cloud CRM solution and visual analytics technology. The funding was aimed at helping the firm in market expansion.To gain more insights into the market with a detailed table of content and figures, click here: https://www.meticulousresearch.com/product/healthcare-analytics-market/Scope of the Report:Healthcare Analytics market, by Type Healthcare Analytics Market, by Component Healthcare Analytics Market, by Mode of Delivery Healthcare Analytics Market, by Application Healthcare Market, by End User Healthcare Analytics Market, by Geography Download Free Sample Report Now @ https://www.meticulousresearch.com/download-sample-report/cp_id=3995Amidst this crisis, Meticulous Research® is continuously assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on various sub-markets and enables global organizations to strategize for the post-COVID-19 world and sustain their growth.

While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profits for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them.Cybercrimes also include the use of computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networksIntroductionCybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network. While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profits for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them. Cybercrimes also include the use of computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks.A primary objective of cybercrime is financial; cybercrime can include many different types of profit-driven criminal activity, including ransomware attacks, email and internet fraud, identity fraud, as well as attempts to steal financial accounts, credit card or other payment card information. Cybercriminals may also target an individual’s private information, as well as corporate data for theft and resale.Global Cyber Crime & Attacks at a GlanceThe cyber security industry is rapidly growing every day. Although more resources are being deployed to counter cyber-attacks, the industry still has a long way to go before we can, as a whole, catch up with these threats. Cyber-crime or computer crime can be divided into two categories: the first comprises crimes that target computers directly such as viruses, attacks and malware; the second focuses on online crime that uses computer networks or devices as means to perform fraud,which includes but is not limited to identity theft through social engineering, cyber bullying, cyber stalking and cyber warfare.Data breaches have profound effects on consumers, resulting in personal information and credit details being stolen. The biggest online data breach compromised more than 130 million user accounts. Online brands with the highest chance of being targeted by phishing attacks include online payment providers such asPaypal, online auction houses such as eBay, as well as numerous online service providers that require personal identification.With the ubiquity of the internet, an increased online usage and the spread of social network usage acrossall age groups, cyber bullying and cyber stalking have become increasingly common, but especially among teenagers. Cyber bullying is defined as the harming or harassing of other people in a deliberate, repeated, and hostile manner.Covid-19 has been rightly dominatingthe global headlines so far in 2020, but while global lockdown may have been good news for online retailers and those able to work from home, this invariably means that it has also been a lucrative period for cyber criminals.More online transactions mean more opportunities to hack personal data, and people working remotely has opened up new ways for criminals to target both individuals and organizations (including attacks on healthcare companies battling to contain the virus and save lives).With the world facing a global recession and millions of jobs being lost, these are desperate times that call for serious measures to tackle cybercrime.Global Cyber Security Market SizeThe global cyber security market size was valued at US$ 156.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.0% from 2020 to 2027. Cyber security and defense against online threats undertake greater significance in today’s ever-evolving digital landscape. Cybersecurityhas become vital toorganization due to rapidly increasing frauds, cybercrimes, risk, threats, and vulnerabilities. Disruptive and emerging technologies in banking, retail, information technology, defense, and manufacturing sectors have offered new capabilities, facilitated automation, and accentuated ease of working. However, these technologies have also emerged as a potent factor in the development of the global “threat landscape” of exploitable vulnerabilities and malware. The emerging threat landscape hasobserved an increased number of cybercrime activities in the global digital era.The growing popularity of digitalization has compelled organizations to extensively rely on digitized information. Sharing of a vast amount of data in an external and internal environment as well as across the globe has created many vulnerable communication channels, and has in turn made organizations fall prey to cybercrime through different forms of attacks. A successful online attack can harm the enterprise as well as its reputation and brand. It can further result in a loss of competitive advantage and cause steep financial damage. In the wake of breaches and high-profile data theft, it becomes vital for an organization to determine future threats and redesign their cyber safety stance. Thus, cyber safety is becoming a strategic imperative for an organization, owing to an increased focus on preventing cybercrime activities which can hamper the momentum of the business.Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and new business models extensively rely on global digitization for their growth. As the system becomes more complex, interconnected, and handles more information, the exposure to attack surface becomes much broader while exposing the gaps in the security system of the business. The primary platform for an increase in cybercrime activities is connectivity through the use of Big Data, cloud, social media, and mobile services. For instance, third-party data storage and cloud-based services have opened avenues for an online attack, which previously did not exist. Moreover, IoT products enabled with IP sensors are anticipated to introduce vulnerabilities to user data, if they have not been adequately tested. Such services operate on the backbone of the internet and will become increasingly connected over a period of the next three years, demandingthe need for a robust cyber safety system in the business environment.The convergence of such events has driven the proliferation of endpoint and wireless safety services in an enterprise improving access to corporate information, both on-premise and outside the corporate network. A robust cybersafety layer in a business environment is aimed to detect, prevent, and react to the network attack or cyber-attack at the time of intrusion. A scalable and flexible strategy prepares an organization to combat unforeseen challenges to their safety infrastructure.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, several incidences and cases of Cybercrime were observed across industries. Cybercriminals have increasingly targeted every part of the demographic that searched information related to COVID-19 using malicious domain names registered with names as “COVID-19” or “coronavirus”. According to cyber experts, at the end of March 2020, around 40,261 suspicious registered domain names were identified. Additionally, in recent times the use of almost identical business email addresses havebecome apreferable choice for cyber attackers to conduct attacks. Furthermore, with the shift towards the remote working environment, cyber threat risks increase among organizations. The pressing concerns of cyber threats influence organizations to adopt solutions and configure malware protection, detection, and mitigation strategies.Component InsightsThe services segment dominated in 2019 with a 54.7% revenue share of the cyber security market. It is also anticipated to continue its dominance over the forecast period. Cyber security vendors offer both professional and managed services to provide IT support and assistance for troubleshooting software issues and carrying out regular maintenance. Furthermore, the need for continuous event monitoring, vulnerability management, and real-time dedicated security support for timely delivery of products is compelling enterprises to adopt these services. Thus, this need for timely support and professional assistance is expected to aid the growth of the cyber security market subsequently. Moreover, the rising trend of employing third-party vendors by organizations owing to their robust solutions offered at optimum costs hasboosted the growth of Security as a Service (SaaS).The hardware segment is expected to register the highest CAGR over the forecast period. The hardware comprises of next-generation equipment and devices such as encrypted USB flash drives, firewalls, and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) equipment that secure the organization’s IT networks by monitoring their networks from malicious incidents. These hardware systems and equipments are deployed by large enterprises, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that usemultiple computers control the network activity. The hardware equipment protects the network activity by forming an additional layer of defense from attacks and thwarts attempts to unlawfully enter computing systems. The segment revenue is majorly concentrated around protecting the network stacks.The growing trend to identify, monitor, and mitigate threats in real-time is influencing enterprises to adopt advanced solutions such as security analytics, advanced SIEM solutions, advanced malware, and threat detection solutions. Furthermore, increasing demand to protect complex IT infrastructures from advanced threats and malware while delivering content across the web and deploying client solutions using cloud also influences enterprises to adopt solutions toenhance their IT safety infrastructure. Digital transformation and digital workplace trends also augment segment growth.Security Type InsightsThe infrastructure protection segment dominated the market in 2019 and accounted for 27.8% revenue share. Due to the increase in the number of online attacks globally, mitigation of the losses arising out of these incidents has become a significant concern across all the sectors. Furthermore, the growing adoption of connected systems across industries that share sensitive data over the internet increases cyber risks. The increasing online attacks on the organization’s critical infrastructures, IT infrastructure space, and industrial processes are anticipated to boost demand for infrastructure protection. Additionally, an increasing number of government regulations worldwide regarding data safety and privacy and compliance areanticipated to be a key factor boosting the segment growth.The cloud security segment is anticipated to expand at the highest CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to the growing adoption of cloud-based deployment solutions and services among enterprises. Moreover, the increasing risk of malware infiltrations, risks of unauthorized access, and the increasing number of threat actors across cloud layers are compellingenterprises to adopt cloud solutions and services. Additionally, the rise in web traffic to access media content is also propelling segment growth.Solution InsightsThe Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution segment dominated the market in 2019 and accounted for 29.6% revenue share. The growth can be attributed to the growing adoption of mobile endpoints across organizations, which increases vulnerability and risk of breaches. Furthermore, the increasing use of cloud computing and shared networks to access critical organizational data is also driving the need for IAM solutions. Rising insider threat attacks and the need to automatically maintain IAM policies such as password management, roles and privilege management, and change in historical policies. Moreover, increased demand for IAM in BFSI aimed to manage and identify risks associated with user access is anticipated to propel the segment growth over the forecast period.The IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)-IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems) segment is anticipated to expand at the highest CAGR of over 11.1% during the forecast period. These solutions improve network security by analyzing and monitoring the events of known threats, thereby mitigating potentially harmful incidents in the networks. Furthermore, the increase in IT security spending and increase in adoption of network security products is expected to drive this market over the forecast period. Additionally, the sophistication of hacking attempts and an increase in cyber threats are expected to fuel the market growth. The need to avoid potential data loss and data leakage due to cyber-attacks is the primary factor driving the segment growth. Both insider and outsider attacks account for equal threats and warrant public disclosure of data, which can negatively impact the organization’s finances.Service InsightsThe professional service segment dominated the services segment with a market share of over 70.0% in 2019. The growth is attributed to the demand for employee training, penetration testing, enterprise risk assessment, cyber security defense, and physical security testing. The vendors assess the overall enterprise risks and business requirements before implementing cyber safety solutions. With the use of extensive knowledge, organizations could minimize the additional costs that come withmonitoring and managing security projects. The operational assistance provided as a professional service also reduces gaps in staffing skilled professionals and improves support efficiency in managing IT infrastructure.The managed services segment is expected to register the fastest CAGR over the forecast period, owing to increased threats from conventional insurgent activities. Further, the increasing dangers posed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) are helping SME and large enterprises to build cyber-capabilities with services such as prevention, detection, and remediation. The IT support extends their support to manage, monitor, and analyze the cyber capabilities of the implanted solution.Cyber Crime in India at a GlanceCyberspace is a fast growing area for crime, transcending national boundaries and assuming global proportions. A computer or a mobile telephone with access to the Internet offers a wide array of tools, some of which may be illegal to use, and a bit of technical expertise is what it takes to perpetuate a crime in relative obscurity from remote areas.Experts have defined cyberspace as a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.As people become more and more socially and economically dependent on Internet-connected computers and e-governance — where a lot of government business and public services are transacted online, including e-banking, e-payments, e-commerce, etc. — there grow, especially in India, prospective targets for cyber-crime assume a mammoth scale. The numbers say it all.With a projected 730 million in 2020, India ranks third in the number of Internet users after the USA and China, clocking a compound annual growth rate of 44% over the past few years. It also figures among the top five countries to be affected by cyber-crime.In December last year, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology informed Parliament that the number of cyber-related crimes cases registered in the country went up by 77% in two years. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data reveals that 12,317 cyber-crime cases were registered under provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and related sections of the Indian Penal Code as well as other special and local laws in 2016, which spiked to 21,796 in 2017. In 2015, 11,592 cases were registered.The NCRB data also shows that Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka were the top three states, respectively, in registering cyber-crimes. The regional states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh were lower in the pecking order.Tackling Cyber CrimeSeveral measures such as formulating new policies, setting up security centres, increased surveillance and monitoring, issuing advisories and devising standard operating procedures have been initiated to protect information and information infrastructure, build capabilities to prevent and respond to cyber threats, reduce vulnerabilities, and minimise damage from cyber incidents, but there are shortcomings such as financial constraints, an acute shortage of resource persons and domain experts ,and inadequate research in academia.Increasing attacks on cyber security systemsHow cyber security products and services are expected to pan outThe study estimates that the market for cyber securityproducts in India will grow at a higher rate thanthat forservices. The existing portfolio of cyber spending will changewith products becoming dominant,as organisations investmore in products powered by specialised technologies.Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)applications are being embedded into the cyber suite ofofferings—especially in security intelligence, detectionand response (IDR), endpoint security and security testing.The key use cases stem from the ability to use predictiveanalytics and heuristics in drawing quickstatisticalinferences, thereby helping in detecting and lesseningthreats with optimised number ofresources and savings. Anatural outcome of such developments is the emergence ofproducts and platforms specialising in these areas.While the products market is estimated to grow at a CAGRof 16.9% over three years and reach USD 1.64 billion by2022, the market for cyber security services will grow toUSD 1.41 billion by 2022, at a CAGR 14.2%.Gradual shift in favour of cyber security productsAs per study estimates, the cyber security market in India isexpected to grow from USD 1.97 billion in2019 to USD 3.05billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 15.6%—almost one and halftimes the global rate.Products & ServicesSteady growth is estimated in both the segments, withcyber security products growing at 16.9% CAGRandservices at 14.2% CAGR. However with technologyinnovation, the scale is slightly tilted in favour of cybersecurity products, which occupy a wider market share ascompared to cyber security services.The analysis reveals that market contribution of cybersecurity products to the overall demand willincrease from52% of the mix in 2019 to 54% by 2022.Cyber Security ProductsGrowth of the Cyber Security products market in IndiaThe cyber security products market in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.9% by 2022. The cyber security products market has been classified in five categories, viz. datasecurity, endpoint security, network security, identity and access management, and security Intelligencedetection and response (IDR).Cyber Security ServicesThe cyber security services market hasbeen classified in five categories for clearerunderstanding, viz.security consulting,security implementation, security testing,security operations and incident response:Security operations to remain the largest amongst Cyber Security ServicesIt is expected that thesecurity operations marketin India will grow fromUS$367 million in 2019to US$533 million by2022, at a CAGR of 13.3%and occupy 38% of India’scyber security servicesmarket.Effective incident response is the key to Effective Cyber Security in the era of Inevitable Cyber BreachesThe incident response andforensics services space inIndia is expected to growfrom US$48 million in2019 to US$75 million by2022, at a CAGR of 16.3%.Sectoral AnalysisBFSI, IT/ITeS and Government are the top 3 sectorswith the largest market share in cyber securityexpenditure in India.The BFSI sector accountsfor 26% of the totalexpenditure in the cybersecurity market. Thesector is expected toincrease its expenditureto US$810 million fromthe existing US$518 million by 2022, at a CAGRof 16.1%. The growthcan be attributed toseveral factors such astightened directives fromregulators, rapid adoptionof technologies like digitallending, utility payments,e-commerce, onlineinsurance marketplacesand mobile banking—to drive operationalefficiency and customerconvenience.Digital disruption has forced companies to take a look at their digital strategies.The nature of services provided by the BFSI sectorhas resulted in the sector being governed by detailedprescriptive guidelines and regulations.Cyber-attacks in the BFSI sector have evolved from merely being about cyber-crime to efforts in crippling the economy.Threats and awareness on privacy are driving the demand forcyber security in the IT and ITeS sectorThecyber security spendin the IT/ITeS sector isexpected to grow fromUS$434 million in 2019 toUS$713 million by 2022,at a CAGR of 18% – thehighest among all sectors.Cyber threats have become a major challenge in the IT/ITeS sector as:It is estimated that by 2021,there will be 1.5 networked devices per individual. Withthe IT sector beingone of thelargest employers globally,there is a huge upsurgeexpected in the number ofend points,which have latelybeen identified as the mostvulnerable point of entry forcyber-attacks.IT/ITeS organisations store plethora ofvaluable client information and are hencetargeted by cyberhackers. Many of theseare caused by targeted or unintendedsecurity exposure of client informationdue to security risks owning to distributednature of the services supply chain. Thissector grew the fastest at a CAGR of 18%.Government’s push for cyber security is largely driven by the Digital India initiativesThe cyber security marketin the government sectoris estimated to grow fromUS$395 million in 2019toUS$581 million by 2022,at a CAGR of 13.8%. Thisgrowth is primarily drivenby increased focus ondigitisation of governmentsystems and risingcyber-attacks on criticalstate infrastructure.Digital delivery of services is transforming the waycitizens interact with the government. Some of themajor digital services provided by the Government ofIndia are:The threat landscape is now changing fromdefacement of websites to attacks on critical stateinfrastructure from state actors to destabilise thecountry.Government’s strong commitment to cyber securityis resulting in prescriptive mandates andguidelines.Some steps taken by the government to addresscyber security issues are:Healthcare and energy are two sectors likely to fuel the growth driven by need for privacy and safetyThe cyber securityspend in other sectorsis expected to growfrom US$630 million in2019 to US$949 millionby 2022, at a CAGR of14.6%. The major sectorsunder this ambit includeenergy, healthcare andautomotive. This growthcan be attributed to rapidadoption of emergingdigital technologies,increased cyberthreatsand upcoming regulations.Globally, the healthcare sector is one of the keysectors and second only to BFSI in driving the cybersecurity market. In India, the sector has not beenprimarily targeted by hackers, so far. However,the recent developments with regard to use oftechnology are expected to increase demand of cybersecurity safeguards in the sector.India is on the cusp of digitalhealth transformation, whichin turn will increase the threatlandscape,driving expenditureon cyber security in this sector.Energy SectorEnergy is another key sector (including oil andgas, power and utilities) in which cyber securityexpenditure is expected to increase. Some of theareas in the energy sector where use of technologyand cyberthreats are growing are:The Ministry of Power has mandated a CISO position for allutilities, released as per Indian Standard IS16335 (SecurityStandard for Power Systems). The Ministry has also notifiedinformation sharing anddirected relevant bodies to setup analysis centres. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA)is developing acyber-security manual for auditing powerutilities.Automobile SectorThe automotive industry is facing an inflectionpoint—as risks for cyber security, privacy and safetywill increase with internet connectivity in the sectorand automotive products becoming commonplace.The automobile ecosystem has used technology totransform into an integrated supply chain. On onehand,this has helped in reducing cycle time and improving rateof manufacturing; on the other, it hasalso resulted inincreased threat for intellectual property rights (IPR).ConclusionSeveral essential parts of our critical information infrastructure, whether they be in banking, energy or telecom, are owned by the private sector.Be it a cloud computing architecture or a VPN server, the owners and operators of critical infrastructure need to have a stratified information sharing mechanism with the government given the varying degrees of maturity in security practices among different entities.In India, the remit of public private collaboration has been fairly limited to just the context of education and awareness programs, such as the Cyber Shikshaa project for skilling women engineering graduates. This must be expanded towards creating self-governed coordinating sector councils known as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) that facilitate early warning systems and crisis management, not just within these sectors, but as cross-sectoral coordination.The synapse between the COVID-19 pandemic and cybersecurity imperatives can be addressed with a call to action that the new Cyber Security Strategy on the anvil can address. New red lines that have emerged only draws to us the reality that it isn’t possible to hermetically seal our societies or the networks. The new policy must be in sync with these modern realities and look to adapt to future disruptions, thereby reinvigorating trust and boosting our digital immunity.By Mr. Aditya SekharResearch Scholar in Smart Cities & Electronic Security SystemBy Mr.Nisarg Bhushan GagraniB.Tech IIT, Financial Analyst "

0,The Critical Need for a Population Health Approach: Addressing the Nation's Behavioral Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond,https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2020/20_0261.htm,"
			COMMENTARY â Volume 17 â August 6, 2020		Suggested citation for this article: Evans AC, Bufka LF. The Critical Need for a Population Health Approach: Addressing the Nation’s Behavioral Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond. Prev Chronic Dis 2020;17:200261. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd17.200261external icon.PEER REVIEWEDWhat is known about this topic?Behavioral health needs in the United States are not being met by the current health care system, and the COVID-19 pandemic will likely dramatically increase the need for psychological services.What is added by this report?Adopting a population health approach provides opportunities to target interventions to those populations and communities most in need of psychological health care services, with the potential of preventing development of disorders.What are the implications for public health practice?Implementing and evaluating population health strategies to promote overall well-being requires system change that translates to policy decisions and programs to meet the needs of local communities.The COVID-19 global pandemic highlights the necessity for a population health approach to identify and implement strategies across systems to improve behavioral health. Adopting a population health approach helps to address the needs of the total population, including at-risk subgroups, through multiple levels of intervention and to promote the public’s behavioral health and psychological well-being.TopCalls to bring a population health framework to the nation’s health care system have been increasing. Although this approach had been steadily gaining traction for physical health (1), using this approach with respect to behavioral health (ie, mental health and substance use conditions) has only recently been considered (2,3). However, the need for this approach has never been so apparent as it is during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Individuals and communities are grappling with the spread of the virus, the struggle to effectively treat all infected individuals, and the challenges of physical distancing and quarantine, all while attempting to reopen the economy. These challenges, along with the economic impact of prolonged school and business closures and high levels of stress and uncertainty, exact a tremendous psychological toll on many people in the United States (4). The existing capacity of the US health care system to address the resulting behavioral health needs is severely limited (5). A population health approach is needed to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inadequacies of the nation’s current approach to behavioral health needs, which have been magnified during the pandemic (6).The current approach to behavioral health care in the United States is primarily a one-on-one approach that focuses on individuals who have a clinical diagnosis (7). This approach drastically limits the number of people for whom the appropriate level of care is available, let alone addressing the needs of those whose level of psychological distress does not reach the diagnostic threshold. As a result, many people with high levels of stress and uncertainty are left without appropriate psychological support and miss the opportunity for prevention and early intervention.TopBehavioral health encompasses traditional mental health and substance use disorders, as well as overall psychological well-being (8). Behavioral health can be understood as the behaviors that affect physical and mental health, and good behavioral health results in a “state of mind characterized by emotional well-being, good behavioral adjustment, relative freedom from anxiety and disabling symptoms, and a capacity to establish constructive relationships and cope with the ordinary demands and stresses of life” (9). Obtaining and maintaining behavioral health requires flexibility, the ability to understand and manage emotions, engaging in behaviors that are healthy for the body and the mind, awareness of one’s relationship to others and recognition of one’s responses, and effectively employing strategies to deal with the demands of living.The manifestation of behavioral health varies over the lifespan and across cultures. Similarly, the large number of factors that influence behavioral health must also be acknowledged: genetics, family environment, discrimination, socioeconomic status, traumatic experiences, physical health, loneliness, culture, and a host of others (10). Supporting behavioral health often means addressing social determinants of health through an array of social and community factors (11). For instance, when individuals and communities lack economic stability, physical survival alone can be a challenge. The focus is on getting what is needed to live, which will not necessarily include what is needed to thrive. Integrating behavioral health with community access to job training programs is one example of increasing access to behavioral health services and to psychological skill development to help individuals navigate the challenges of seeking employment.We need to be as concerned about a population’s psychological well-being as we are about its physical well-being. Psychological well-being is neither a categorical nor a permanent state. That is, people are not either mentally healthy or unhealthy (eg, meeting diagnostic criteria for a psychological disorder, such as depression or schizophrenia; developing a substance use problem). A person’s or population’s overall psychological well-being falls on a continuum and changes over time. To truly recognize and support degrees of mental wellness on that continuum requires changing how we identify and meet the behavioral health needs of the population.TopHow behavioral health is addressed within our health care system must change. Currently, one must typically have a diagnosis to have care covered by insurance; therefore, early intervention and prevention is difficult, and in many places in the United States, access to services is limited (12). Furthermore, specialist behavioral health care professionals, such as psychologists and psychiatrists, work in settings distinct from where most of individuals live, work, play, and worship, creating both physical and psychological barriers to access.Although more integration of professionals who specialize in behavioral health care into primary care and other settings has occurred, the trend is not universal and it does not go far enough in reaching people in other settings. In instances in which this integration has occurred, the behavioral health expert has the capacity to immediately meet with individuals who have identified behavioral health needs, triage the concerns, and determine appropriate next steps, thereby reducing the number of individuals who are “lost” in the transition to specialty care. Also, the psychologist or other behavioral health care professional frequently provides consultation and support to nonbehavioral health care professionals, helping to educate them as well as reduce the stigma often associated with patients who have behavioral health care needs (13). Integrated care improves on our current approach by providing a range of interventions and reaching people “where they are” (13). This approach, similar to a population health approach, emphasizes addressing behavioral health needs — regardless of whether the person has a diagnosis — and building the capacity of the setting to address behavioral health needs along a continuum.Addressing behavioral health within the health care system alone is not sufficient. Many individuals do not have a regular primary care provider. Of those who do, the behavioral health needs being addressed are those further along the continuum toward distress, impairment, and disorder. Because only 50% of individuals with behavioral health concerns actually enter any form of treatment (14), we must develop new strategies to reach people wherever they are — at work, in school, and in the community. Furthermore, we must engage the communities themselves, which have the wisdom to address many of these problems but may need the resources and expertise of mental health professionals to do so.TopBehavioral health needs have long been insufficiently met in the United States, and the population is now facing increasing psychological stress and significant growing needs as the pandemic unfolds (15). According to a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA), the average stress level reported by US adults in May 2020 was significantly higher than that reported in the 2019 survey (data collected in August), and it is the first significant increase in average reported stress since APA first started surveying American households about stress more than a decade ago (16). Furthermore, some groups in the APA survey, such as parents with children younger than 18 and Hispanic adults, reported even higher levels of stress. Stress that is not addressed can become chronic and result in physical and behavioral health problems such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammation, and depression (17).Analyses from previous pandemics (18,19), as well as studies about COVID-19 coming from China (20) and Italy (21), indicate that we should expect an increase in a variety of behavioral health symptoms, especially among front-line health care workers. Emerging data suggest that health care workers treating individuals with COVID-19 are reporting significant distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia (22). At a minimum, those on the front lines of addressing COVID-19 need onsite emotional support and the capacity to meet their own basic needs such as obtaining food, transportation, and personal protective equipment. Some of those on the front lines experiencing distress will want and benefit from more focused, brief psychological interventions intended to provide them with skills that enable them to cope with highly stressful work situations (eg, Psychological First Aid, Skills for Psychological Recovery) (23). Unfortunately, many hospitals are not set up to provide this kind of psychological support (24,25).Furthermore, a 2020 systematic review of the psychological impact of quarantine indicated that individuals experience an array of negative effects, including anger, confusion, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (26). These effects are heightened when quarantine is of a longer duration, people have fears of infection, receive inadequate or unclear information, and face financial loss. If the pandemic is similar to other community traumas (27), most individuals will adapt and demonstrate resilience, but a minority will develop a behavioral health condition that requires intervention.The long-term population health needs resulting from the pandemic could be substantial. Although humans are remarkably resilient, some individuals benefit from psychological intervention. In addition to workers on the front lines (eg, health care professionals, essential workers) who may develop disorders such as depression or posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of their experiences treating individuals with COVID-19, many other segments of the US population (and worldwide) are also likely to need interventions in some form. In the current environment of quarantine and physical distancing, patients with COVID-19 are typically separated from their families and do not have the benefit of the close emotional support and physical help of their loved ones.The families and friends of patients with COVID-19 experience high levels of stress, which is magnified in cases in which they are unable to be present when their loved ones die. Furthermore, because traditional funerals and other rituals are not possible in the current environment, survivors must create new ways to mourn. Individuals who survive COVID-19 may have major behavioral health needs that we are only beginning to understand. For instance, research makes clear that the experience of being on a ventilator and staying in an intensive care unit for an extended period of time can be traumatic (28,29). Some individuals may face cognitive challenges as they recover from the infection, which necessitates specialized behavioral health care (30).In addition to the large numbers of individuals who have had direct experience with COVID-19, the US population has also experienced some degree of stress as a result of the nation’s sweeping efforts to reduce transmission of the virus. Many individuals have struggled to cope with the uncertainty of stay-at-home orders, changes in work and financial status, facilitating their children’s online schooling, virus-related discrimination, and major disruptions in routines and plans. Each of these factors poses the potential for the development of ongoing stress and its fallout. Of particular concern are people facing both significant financial distress and experiencing discrimination, as both of these stressors are linked to the development of future behavioral health problems (31,32).TopIn the face of this kind of population distress, the importance of using public health strategies, rather than relegating behavioral health to treatment by specialist providers only, cannot be overstated. Promoting population behavioral health has the potential to increase overall resiliency and reduce the number of individuals who ultimately develop behavioral health problems, and improvements in behavioral health can also lead to improvements in physical health (33). This crisis, although difficult, can provide an opportunity to make this shift. Philadelphia (34) and New York City (35) have adopted a population health approach to behavioral health and provide models for how to begin. Key aspects of this work include the necessity of reimagining what a behavioral health system is and how one operates and to establish a broad, evidence-based vision of what that entails.This change needs to happen both at the national and the local level. National leadership can highlight issues, advocate for resources, and encourage solutions, but implementation must take place at the local level to best meet community needs. Unfortunately, many local health governments are not actively engaged in systematic activities to promote behavioral health. Although local leaders often recognize the priority of doing so, they often do not control the behavioral health resources in their communities, which are often administered at the state or county level. Consequently, local leaders cite as barriers limited resources, knowledge, and data along with the challenges of communicating and collaborating with local behavioral health agencies (36). Increasing partnerships between these local governments and behavioral health funding agencies is essential for success.The American Psychological Association (APA) is using a population health framework to tackle the emerging behavioral health issues associated with this pandemic. APA has identified several principles to guide this work (Box), conceptualized as taking place across 3 broad levels of the population: 1) those with behavioral health conditions requiring clinical intervention, 2) those who are experiencing subclinical psychological distress or who are at great risk for experiencing clinically significant behavioral health problems, and 3) those who are relatively healthy.• Use data and the best available science to inform policies, programs, and resources.• Prevent when possible and otherwise intervene at the earliest moment.• Strategize, analyze, and intervene at the community/population level (in addition to the individual).• Reach broad and diverse audiences through partnerships and alliances.• Utilize a developmental approach (eg, change over time, age-appropriate interventions).• Consider the “whole person” and the structural/systemic factors impacting individual behavior.• Be culturally sensitive while also thinking transculturally.• Recognize that inherent in every community is the wisdom to solve its own problems.• Champion equity by addressing systemic issues (eg, social determinants of health, access to treatment).Strategies and interventions must be tailored to achieve the health goals at each of these levels. Indicated approaches to behavioral health target the first level. These approaches are often provided by specialists, such as psychologists, to individuals with clear problems or disorders and use evidence-based strategies to reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Selective approaches to behavioral health are designed to reduce risk or mitigate the impact of risk factors that lead to psychological distress, for example using targeted, scalable interventions designed to build people’s ability to adapt and cope. Universal approaches are intended to promote general behavioral wellness, with a focus on messages to the public to destigmatize mental illness, promote psychoeducation about responses to stress, and focus attention on the foundation necessary to support and maintain psychological well-being. A population health approach has, as its goal, optimal behavioral health and wellness across the continuum of need. This approach addresses the need to “get upstream” as it promotes intervention before individuals need clinical services. It also shifts the goal of practitioners to behavioral wellness and not just the absence of psychopathology. Because this is a significant paradigmatic shift for most behavioral health professionals and the systems in which they work, we will need to develop leaders and professionals who can work from this public health perspective. From a systems perspective, individual localities should determine their own needs and collaboratively work with local experts — members of the public, scientists, providers, policy makers, and others — to design and implement the programs that each community needs.TopThe pandemic has elevated stress levels nationwide, with serious implications. Chronic stress is linked to greater risk for a range of adverse health outcomes, so adopting a rigorous, evidence-based approach to identifying needs and designing interventions is critical. In the United States, there have been some effective public education campaigns to encourage handwashing, physical distancing, and mask wearing to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Similarly, key messages can be developed and used to increase the public’s capacity to handle stress, cope with the current uncertainty, and manage distress to slow the development of behavioral health problems. The opportunity to act is now, before a behavioral health pandemic develops and accelerates and too many lives are disrupted or lost.Using a population approach to behavioral health holds much promise. It will allow us to address many long-standing issues that affect our current behavioral health system by placing a greater emphasis on prevention and early intervention and by reaching underserved subgroups. It will also enable us to simultaneously and effectively address the potential surge in need caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenge will be reorienting and training the workforce to adopt this perspective, develop new interventions, and build the service infrastructure to meet a broader range of behavioral health needs. Furthermore, we need to develop a fiscal and regulatory policy framework to support this work. Finally, evaluation of these changes can be essential to determine how future population health approaches can be effective at improving not only the psychological well-being of those impacted by COVID-19 but also the overall behavioral health of the US population. Although there are important examples of the successful implementation of a population mental health approach, these are rare exceptions. The behavioral health pandemic that is likely to emerge as a result of COVID-19 creates urgency and should spur immediate action. We have a window of opportunity where the public and policy makers can see firsthand that behavioral health concerns are affecting a large proportion of the population and that we need an approach and the resources to address the full range of these concerns. Action must be taken for the health and well-being of our nation.TopThe authors wrote this commentary as part of their work at the American Psychological Association with no external financial support.

0,Younger and more diverse Parliament faces age-old challenge of tackling job issues amid COVID-19,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/younger-more-diverse-parliament-faces-jobs-challenge-covid-19-13045600,"meREWARDS lets you get coupon deals, and earn cashback when you complete surveys, dine, travel and shop with our partners SINGAPORE: A younger and more gender-diverse Parliament, which opens on Monday (Aug 24), will have its hands full with one important job in the near future: creating and matching employment opportunities for Singaporeans.The 14th Parliament will convene in the midst of an economic downturn spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has triggered Singapore’s worst recession since independence and the country’s highest unemployment rate in more than a decade.Several first-time parliamentarians in the new House, which comprises 83 elected Members of Parliament (MPs) from the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP), 10 from the opposition Workers’ Party, as well as two Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs), cited the jobs challenge among the key issues they plan to speak about.Mr Alvin Tan, 40, a first-time MP-elect for the PAP, said he will focus his maiden speech particularly on helping professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) find more opportunities and match them with potential employers.“What interests me specifically is how we can ensure our workforce is nimble to meet the demands of a COVID-19 world that has accelerated digitalisation and that has come much sooner than any of us expected,” said Mr Tan, who will join the Cabinet as Minister of State from Sep 1.In his previous role as head of public policy and economics at professional networking portal LinkedIn, Mr Tan said he has seen a growing gap between new jobs that have emerged and the skill sets of jobseekers.Existing schemes like SkillsFuture may also not be enough to bridge the gap between what employers need and what jobseekers can offer, added the Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency (GRC) MP.“We have schemes like SkillsFuture and Singaporeans are also learning new skills. But how then do you ensure that they are relevant to the job?” said Mr Tan, pointing out that an additional challenge is in ensuring employers are aware of potential employees with the right skill sets.Another rookie MP who also plans to put the limelight on job concerns - especially the plight of older workers - is former health and social services sector veteran Ng Ling Ling from Ang Mo Kio GRC.Ms Ng, 48, said the Government’s plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65, as well as the re-employment age from 67 to 70, would enable seniors to stay gainfully employed.But she added that there is a need to improve social attitudes and workplace culture towards older workers.Citing a survey that Randstad, a Singapore recruitment agency, released in February which showed only 63 per cent of employees polled felt their workplace “values all employees regardless of age”, Ms Ng said such attitudes were telling of unconscious bias against older workers.“I think support for job redesign must also look into the softer aspect of work inclusivity of more senior workers. In this area, I think social service agencies and professionals are adept,” Ms Ng told CNA.“They are good at designing systemic environments and practices that can build the psychosocial wellness of people, bringing in the elements of respect, dignity and empowerment.”Mr Leong Mun Wai from the Progress Singapore Party, who will be one of its two NCMPs, said his concerns about jobs are focused on “reworking the balance” between foreigners and Singaporeans in the job market.He said recent data on the job situation here – particularly news that 43 per cent of senior management roles in the financial sector are held by Singaporeans - is something that “we really have to look into and see how to rectify in the shortest possible time”.National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser agreed that while jobs will be the most critical topic in Parliament, issues that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the economy’s reliance on foreign labour, might come up.“How do we make sure that we have a strong Singapore core and not be so dependent on foreign labour?“We must make sure that Singaporeans must be given the opportunity to be able to be at the forefront of the different sectors in industry, whether that be finance, manufacturing or SMEs (small- and medium-size enterprises),” Dr Tan told CNA.Topics of debate within Parliament might also traverse other social issues that have come under the spotlight as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.“There is a lot of talk in the press about how COVID-19 has exposed the underbelly of society ... inequality, poverty, social mobility. These are issues that are perennial issues and that have to be addressed,” said Dr Tan.Singapore Management University (SMU) sociology professor Paulin Tay Straughan thinks one such inequality that may preoccupy this Parliament is the issue of migrant workers, particularly with regards to their living conditions.“How do we make it better? We are land-scarce, we are also very price-conscious, because the cost component is a very important factor for us, and it’s too arrogant to say, ‘It’s okay, this is a collective decision that things will have to cost more’, because who am I to say that? There are many Singaporeans who are living day to day,” said Prof Straughan.PREVIOUS “CRISIS” PARLIAMENTSWhile the 14th Parliament will sit for the first time in the middle of what Singapore’s leaders have dubbed a “serious crisis” and the country’s worst economic contraction since independence in 1965, it is not the first time that a Singapore Parliament has opened in the midst of a global crisis.On Monday night, President Halimah Yacob will officiate at the swearing-in ceremony of the MPs and give an address on the Government’s priorities and policies in the new term following the Jul 10 General Election. The House will reconvene later to debate over the address.CNA analysed the Presidents’ Addresses and subsequent MPs’ debates for all previous Parliaments and found two particular instances where the first sittings of previous Parliaments bore a resemblance to the “crisis” nature of the current time.In 1977, the first sitting of the 4th Parliament took place on Feb 7, at a time when the world was then stricken by an oil crisis precipitated by a 1973 oil embargo by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).It was enacted against the US and other countries perceived to be supporting Israel in the Arab-Israeli War and caused a quadrupling of global oil prices by the time the embargo ended in 1974. The economic fallout was felt on a global scale as a recession.Amid the economic turmoil and also the ongoing Cold War between the US and the then-Soviet Union, the focus of late president Benjamin Sheares’ address was on the existential threat of communism, even while he spoke out against being “overwhelmed by the standards and norms of the contemporary West”.“We have to formulate our way of life, taking what is best from the West and fitting it into the Singapore context. We must not allow our values and our philosophy of what is good government to be overwhelmed by the standards and norms of the contemporary West, regardless of their relevance to our social, economic and political conditions, simply because, for the time being the West have the material abundance and technological superiority,” Dr Sheares was quoted as saying to the 4th Parliament.In the MPs’ debate that followed, the 69 members of the House spoke about fundamental building blocks of society, particularly education. In fact, education was the most mentioned word in the debate on the President’s Address that year, followed closely by “policy” and then only “nation” and “economy”.In March 2002, the 10th Parliament opened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks that happened just months before. The global economy – and Asian economies in particular – were also recovering from economic shocks such as the collapse of the global IT industry in 2001 and the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.Then-president S R Nathan’s address to Parliament placed heavy emphasis on the economy, highlighting increasing global competitiveness that Singapore would have to contend with in sectors like electronics and finance, as well as the need to restructure the economy to sustain growth.Mentions of the word “economy” far outstripped any other keyword in his President’s Address that year, with “Asia” and “society” coming in second and third, and only being mentioned less than half the number of times.“We cannot afford to shelter inefficient, protected sectors in our economy. All parts of our economy must become competitive and efficient, for that is the only way to create productive, well-paying jobs for our people,” Mr Nathan had said in his address.In the ensuing MPs’ debate, the 10th Parliament had much the same focus, with the top keywords of the debate being “economy”, “jobs” and “workers”.The analysis of past Parliament sittings was featured in a news report on Sunday night (Aug 23) as the last of a three-part series on the 14th Parliament, with the first two focused on the age and gender profile of the parliamentarians.THE YOUNGEST AND MOST GENDER-EQUAL PARLIAMENT While circumstances in which the 14th Parliament of Singapore opens will bear some resemblance to previous Parliaments, it will differ in two aspects: age and gender.The newest House is by some accounts the youngest to be sworn in, with the youngest, Ms Raeesah Khan representing Sengkang GRC, only 27 years old.With the retirement of older members such as 79-year-old former prime minister Goh Chok Tong, the average age of Parliament has fallen from 49.6 to 48.3.And while that is still above the median age of 42.2 in Singapore, it is the closest that Parliament has got in terms of representing the age demographic of Singaporeans in the past 20 years.For the WP’s Sengkang GRC MP Jamus Lim, 44, the age of the team might be a benefit in terms of understanding constituents’ concerns. Sengkang has a younger demographic than the national average.“It helps that we have a young team of our own, facing the sort of challenges young parents face: waking up in the middle of the night to comfort a crying child, looking for school placements, concerns about the highly competitive educational system that our children will face,” said the economics lecturer in a written response to CNA.Still, Dr Lim added that elderly concerns will not be forgotten, and that the most important contribution that MPs can make is to listen.“Being a good parliamentary representative is about reflecting these competing concerns and interests adequately,” said Dr Lim.PAP’s Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin, who at 30 years old is one of the youngest members of the 14th Parliament, said that even when talking about “youth”, there needs to be an awareness of the demographic’s diversity.“We need to be cognisant that when we talk about youth, the spectrum of youth is broad. There are youth who are still in secondary school and beyond that institutes of higher learning: polytechnics, ITE, universities.“And then moving beyond that you have fresh graduates and then young parents. So the spectrum is wide, and the needs and concerns of youth are diverse,” she added.MORE WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT A GOOD SIGNWith gender, the 14th Parliament sets another record: It has the most number of female members since 1965 – 28, including non-constituency MPs.Members say that the record number of female lawmakers will help contribute to deeper thinking when it comes to policies that disproportionately affect women.“It will definitely broaden and also deepen the thinking behind policies that impact women proportionally more.“And these are issues such as caregiving, elder care, which affects women's lives in a very significant manner. And the fact that we have to face work-care conflict, which is something that bears more attention on the policy making front,” said the PAP’s Ms Carrie Tan, 38, a first-time MP from Nee Soon GRC.Ms Corrina Lim, Executive Director of gender equality advocacy group AWARE, agreed that the increasing number of female parliamentarians is a positive sign.And while she hopes that issues such as gender violence or the gender pay gap will see more airtime in Parliament, she also hopes that these issues would not just be confined to the domain of female parliamentarians.“What we hope not to see is that it then deters male parliamentarians from taking up the same issues because they say, ‘Oh now, you know, this is a female parliamentarian’s area so let them speak on it.’“We actually hope that that will not be the case,” she said.Even with the uptick in the number of female lawmakers, Ms Lim cautioned that there still remain significant structural barriers that prevent women from entering the domain of politics.She pointed out that women are still seen to be the primary caregivers in society, and that an MP’s workload and responsibilities to their constituency would be a further add-on to perhaps already heavy responsibilities to women’s families and careers.“So unless you have a really good partner or very strong family networks or maybe no caregiving or limited caregiving duties, it is very difficult to be able to do (MP duties).“So I think it will not be the next election that we will have 50 per cent (female representation) ... I think that there are many other structural barriers that still exist and those could be much more difficult to change,” she said.Nevertheless, at around 29 per cent of the Parliament, female MPs will take up a larger proportion of the house than they have before, making for a 14th Parliament that is more diverse when it comes to age and gender.Political analysts like Professor Eugene Tan said such representation is important.“You add to the legitimacy of Parliament if MPs are seen to be representative of Singapore society as a whole. Because that adds to the ability of Parliament to remain relevant in dealing with the key issues of the day,” said the Singapore Management University law lecturer.“It is no point Parliament debating and passing laws and policies which are not seen to be representative enough in terms of their benefits and in terms of the impact.“And so it becomes crucial for Parliament to be representative and that adds to our system of representative democracy in Singapore.”Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.Copyright© Mediacorp 2020.

The crisis has laid bare systemic injustices in all facets of society, so we have to align around a just recovery and invest in a better future for all.I outline a five-point plan to assist the poorest and most vulnerable people in society, those most exposed to crises such as work and food insecurity, access to healthcare, Covid-19 and the impacts of climate change.First, the prioritisation of health for people and the planet. During the lockdown, waste-pickers saved cities lots of money by doing free collection, segregation and recycling, yet we have not done enough to protect their health and livelihood. We cannot treat people as disposable second-class citizens.We need to focus on a recovery that keeps the poor at the centre of our solutions. Our environment and human rights cannot be compromised.Second, there needs to be a shift and more investments towards solutions, not bailouts.Deprioritise and divest from extractive industries and their boom and bust cycles. Instead of investing billions in bailing out failed state parastatals such as Eskom which threaten the financial stability of our country, we should be investing in the future.Transition our workforce into sustainable economies while prioritising investments in community resiliency and not corporate interests.Third, the replacement of single-use with sustainable systems. There isn’t a country that has sustainably managed single-use plastic because they cannot be managed. They mostly cannot be recycled or composted. The only way to solve the plastic crisis is to stop the production and use of single-use plastic and transition to refill and reuse.Corporations need to redesign their delivery systems to become more sustainable. All this must be complemented by an aggressive demand for corporate and government accountability. Government policies must ensure countries manage their own waste. Policy must be informed by credible, third-party science.Materials with no way of being recycled should not be produced.The worst part is that the companies imply that we should invest in incineration and chemical recycling - technologies that cost a huge amount of money to deal with a problem that should not be created in the first place.We need our government to put in place stronger policies that aim to phase out non-recyclable, single-use plastic.Last, spaces must be created for meaningful engagements with impacted communities. There is a great need to support community efforts to hold dirty industry accountable for health and environmental impacts and ensure that regulators measure and monitor emissions and health impacts and take decisive action to redress the impacts.We find ourselves at a critical crossroads: we can perpetuate an unequal system that has caused multiple crises, or we can take care of the most vulnerable and make decisions that address the causes of our global problems.* Reddy is a campaign researcher at groundWork, Friends of the Earth SA.** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of IOL.Share this article:Sections on IOLFollow IOLMore on IOLLegalTrending on IOLNewspapers© 2020 Independent Online and affiliated companies.

    The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.University of Strathclyde provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK.View all partnersWith borders closed and airlines grounded for almost six months, COVID-19 effectively shut down the global tourism industry at a scale never witnessed before. Besides leisure travel, restriction of movement threatened to destroy volunteer tourism businesses and NGOs (non-governmental organisations), devastating the projects that depend on them for support. The pandemic has especially hit hard the recruitment of volunteer tourists, with some volunteer-sending organisations already forced to take measures to survive.Our work explores many aspects of volunteer tourism. Given the impact of COVID-19 on tourism in general, we wanted to understand how the pandemic has particularly affected this sector. For our study we interviewed Peter Slowe, founder and director of Projects Abroad – a UK outfit that sends paying volunteers to work on projects in developing countries – to gauge how such organisations are dealing with, and recovering from, the effects of the pandemic.In February and March, Projects Abroad reported that volunteers were down by 78% and then in April by 98%, which led to “unavoidable cuts” in its global workforce. Slowe says that some project types are faring better than others. Schools and day-care centres will generally survive, but still suffer from the lack of volunteers and the funding that comes with them. On the other hand, some conservation projects that are normally supported by volunteers may not.A ripple effect is occurring throughout the sector, with those who indirectly rely on the spend of project volunteers turning to more traditional ways of securing their income. There is evidence that poaching and logging are on the increase again.Slowe is also worried about the future of human-rights projects which simply can’t continue without support:We don’t have the volunteers, and there’s nothing we can do if Projects Abroad itself, with its mission to support the disadvantaged in the poorest countries, is not to survive … Without it there can be no rebuilding.With projects effectively halted, even as lockdown eases, priorities on the ground may change, jeopardising the foundations and philosophies of projects built up over many years. Everything these organisations and local NGOs have worked so hard to build is threatened, but there is very little they can do to stop it. In this difficult terrain, many people are taking a wait-and-see approach. Even though travel restrictions are gradually being lifted, it is unclear how quickly – or fearfully – young volunteers will react to any opening up. Despite the dark clouds, Slowe believes that there is a silver lining. He accepts that the volunteer tourism industry has faced a litany of criticism, including doing more harm than good, being self-congratulatory and disingenuous, boosting CVs rather than alleviating poverty and suffering, undermining local labour economies, and allowing foreigners to do jobs they would not be qualified to do back home. So perhaps this crisis may have a Darwinian effect, and only the better organisations will survive. Slowe suggests that as a well-run for-profit organisation, Projects Abroad has been better equipped “with financial reserves” to cope with the pandemic than others.Perhaps COVID-19 presents the survivors of the sector with an opportunity to rebuild – armed with hindsight – a volunteer tourism 2.0. Yes, it has brought the whole tourist industry to its knees, but the need for organisations to use volunteers to meet real needs will persist.There will be a new environment in which wealthy countries that have over-borrowed will cut international aid and charity budgets will become smaller. So volunteer tourism will have to get more serious with more meaningful projects, better-prepared volunteers and interns to fill some of the gap left by governments and charities.Read more: Volunteer tourism: what’s wrong with it and how it can be changed Given the controversial nature and commercialisation of the volunteer tourism sector, and accusations that some projects are superficial and not linked to existing needs, there may be a need to reduce the number of projects and streamline operations. And this will have to be organised by economically viable businesses with substantial reserves to help weather future storms.This will take time and careful planning. Slowe believes that the sector will bounce back eventually:I have no doubt that young people especially will want to travel again and … do something useful. And I think that our model, which combines philanthropy and sound business, will work very well, provided we don’t have too many expectations of rebuilding quickly. We need to take some lessons from this … We have let down people who rely on us because there was no alternative. We will rebuild through carefully constructing new communities of equal respect between our company, local partners and volunteers.But will that be enough? In many ways, COVID-19 has been a wake-up call for the volunteer tourism sector. Everyone involved understands that it cannot just be business as usual, including Slowe:We cannot just repeat … We will do things differently and better in a new world that needs us more. Understanding what was right and what was wrong and building for a future where volunteer tourism is more relevant than ever is the way the sector has to go if it is to serve all of its stakeholders well.It is clear that COVID-19 is forcing organisations to examine past practice, their role and their impact. With solid reflection, there is potential for the industry to reshape, redesign and reconfigure their operations in line with the principles of sustainability. If that leads to accepting the need to change, this could be the first step to recovery.

          Racial disparity in COVID-19 deaths: Seeking economic roots in census data      
John  McLaren 11 August 2020 
In the US, COVID-19 tends to magnify inequalities by disproportionately hitting minorities, particularly African Americans, who suffer from higher COVID-19 mortality rates. Higher rates of infection appear to be the cause rather than factors related to treatment. Using an indirect approach, this column uses census data to identify the socioeconomic factors that cause different racial groups to be differentially exposed to the virus. Very strong racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates are seen for African-American and First Nations populations. Occupation, income, poverty rates, or access to healthcare insurance appears to matter little. Pre-COVID-19 use of public transport, however, may be a significant factor.aAOne of the many alarming features of COVID-19 is its tendency to magnify inequalities by hitting minorities disproportionately. African Americans, Latino/Hispanic, and Native American groups have suffered mortality rates that are in many cases much more than double the national average (e.g. Oppel et al. 2020, Gross et al. 2020, Price-Haywood et al. 2020, Romero and Healy 2020).Researchers have two separate contributions to make on this issue. The first is to measure the size of these disparities. The second, likely the more important, is to identify their sources – particularly to try to identify socioeconomic sources that can be addressed by policy.1 This column will provide a sampling of work on both of those tasks.The most complete data set for measuring COVID-19 racial disparities is that obtained by Oppel et al. (2020), through a Freedom of Information Act suit, of all individual COVID-19 data held by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) up to 28 May 2020. Even this dataset is very limited: a majority of cases lacked either race or county, and the data are all from fewer than a third of US counties, representing 55% of the national population.The per-capita COVID-19 case rate in the data for African Americans is 2.7 times that for whites, and 3.2 times for Latino/Hispanics. The ratios tend to be even greater within each age category. These ratios also vary greatly across the country. Gross et al. (2020) obtain age-corrected relative mortality ratios by state for the 28 states whose data is broken down by race. They report a range of African-American-to-white ratios from a sky-high 18 for Wisconsin down to 0.44 for Pennsylvania. Their aggregate estimate for the US is that COVID-19 mortality is 3.57-times greater for African Americans relative to whites, and 1.88-times greater for Hispanic/Latinos relative to whites.We can thus take it that these disparities are well established in the data and large. Conceptually, one may classify their sources into three categories:(i) factors that lead to higher rates of minorities becoming infected;(ii) factors that lead minorities with the virus to require hospitalisation at higher rates; and(iii) factors that lead to a higher death rate for minority patients once hospitalised.Category (i) could include the concentration of workers in essential services that cannot be done from home, requiring workers to go to a physical workplace where they will be exposed to other workers or customers (Hooper et al. 2020); differential availability of paid sick leave; differences in reliance on public transit (Harris 2020); differences in access to healthcare insurance;2 and differences in residential density.3Categories (ii) and (iii) could include differential incidence of pre-existing conditions that can make a COVID-19 infection more dangerous4 or discrimination in treatment by healthcare institutions.5 Environmental racism6 may contribute to all three categories.7The most direct approach to untangling these three categories is employed by Price-Haywood et al. (2020), who obtained confidential data from a large hospital system in Louisiana on 3,481 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between 1 March and 11 April 2020. For each patient, race, zip code, and medical record were available to the researchers. In total, 70.4% of those who tested positive were Black, while only 31% of the service-area population was Black. About 40% of these patients were hospitalised due to the virus, with 77% of those cases Black; about 9% died in hospital, of which 70.6% were Black.Since the disparity in death rates is the same as the disparity in infection rates (namely, a Black mortality rate that is 2.28 times the average), the disparity seems to be due to category (i) above, and not (ii) or (iii). Further, the authors also estimate a hazard-rate model for mortality conditional on hospitalisation and find that there is no statistically significant effect of race once comorbidities have been controlled for, which seems to confirm that disparities in care in the hospital are not at work in this case. An earlier but much smaller study in Georgia found similar results (Gold et al. 2020).Given that the COVID-19 disparities seem to be more rooted in rates of exposure to the virus than in subsequent treatment, a natural focus is to hunt down socioeconomic reasons for the differential exposure. Here data problems are a major obstacle. Ideally, one would have a large sample of patients and full information about their employment, education, occupation, income, and so on, as well as medical outcomes for each individual, but that is not available. Researcher Merlin Chowkwanyun has commented: “When a patient comes to a clinic, they can self-report their race, but how do they self-report socioeconomic status? How do you actually gather that information?” (Wood 2020).One imperfect workaround can be described as follows. Recall that the mortality data are not broken down by race for most counties; however, population figures are. Suppose that mortality rates for each minority do not vary much across the country. Imagine we regress county mortality rates on county minority-population shares. Then if the population share of minority group i has a positive coefficient, that indicates that group i has a higher-than-average mortality rate, and the ratio of its mortality rate to the average can be backed out with a simple calculation. If, then, the disparity in mortality rates thus measured disappears when we control for additional socioeconomic variables, that can be taken as evidence that those variables are the underlying source of the disparity. This is the approach I take in McLaren (2020).This indirect approach is applied to four census demographic groups: African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, Asian Americans, and the census category ‘American Indian and Alaska Native’, abbreviated here as ‘First Nations’. The control variables are pre-COVID-19 county features, averaged over 2013–8 and taken from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. They include median household income, poverty rate, education, uninsured fraction, the occupational profile of the county, and the fraction who use public transit to get to work.The main findings are:(i) This approach confirms very strong racial disparities in mortality rates, not far out of line with the estimates provided by direct measures.(ii) For Latino/Hispanic and Asian populations, those disparities mostly disappear once education and occupation are controlled for.(iii) By contrast, for African-American and First Nations populations, the disparity is very robust. Surprisingly, it is barely affected by controlling for occupation, income, poverty rates, or – importantly – even access to healthcare insurance, so those factors do not seem to be an important source of the disparity.(iv) One factor that does seem to be significant for the African-American disparity is the pre-COVID-19 use of public transport – at least for April, when the partial correlation between mortality and public transit is very strong. Harris (2020) builds a strong case that the subway was a crucial element in the early spread of COVID-19 in New York City, but that the effect dissipated as ridership dropped, and these results are consistent with that (even when New York City is dropped).These negative results for African Americans and First Nations people can at least help narrow down the search for the source of the disparities. Important candidates that cannot be ruled out at present include:(i) Disproportional employment in ‘essential’ occupations that cannot be done from home. Despite the insignificant effect of occupations in the regressions above, these occupational effects could still be a reason for the disparity because the county occupational categories in the American Community Survey are very crude;8 this may be the reason occupational variables show no significant results (even though they were very significant for the other two minorities).(ii) Residential density. Emeruwa et al. (2020) study every woman admitted for labour and delivery at two New York hospitals over several weeks. As required by law, every one of these patients was tested for COVID-19, making this an ideal sample for studying the correlates of positivity. The authors found that the strongest predictor of COVID-19 positivity was whether or not the patient lived in a neighbourhood with a high average number of people per dwelling. This variable mattered far more than neighbourhood income or population density. Unfortunately, the data do not include race, so it is an open question whether this is a source of the disparity or not.(iii) Environmental racism. Wu et al. (2020) study the effect of county-level particulate matter in the air on COVID-19 death rates and find alarmingly strong effects. Together with the abundant evidence on environmental hazards disproportionately located in minority neighbourhoods, this seems as if it could be a reason for the disparities. However, the study separately controls for the Black population share and finds that it has just as strong an effect as the studies that do not control for pollution.9 This seems to rule out particulate matter as the underlying source of the disparity in death rates, but there are many other forms of environmental harm that could be explored in a similar manner.The inequities of COVID-19 are grotesque. Nailing down which mechanisms are most at fault can help focus attention on which policies are needed to address them. So far, the exact mechanisms have been elusive.Berchick, Edward R, Jessica C Barnett and Rachel D Upton (2019), “Health insurance coverage in the US: 2018”, Current Population Reports P60-267, US Census Bureau.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020), “COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minority groups”.Chowkwanyun, Merlin, and Adolph L Reed, Jr (2020), “Racial health disparities and COVID-19 – caution and context”, The New England Journal of Medicine, 6 May.Desmet, Klaus, and Romain Wacziarg (2020), “Understanding spatial variation in COVID-19 across the US”, NBER Working Paper 27329.Emeruwa, Ukachi N, Samsiya Ona, Jeffrey L Shaman, Amy Turitz, Jason D Wright, Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman and Alexander Melamed (2020), “Associations between built environment, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in New York City”, JAMA, 18 June.Gold, Jeremy A W, et al.

(2020), Johnson (2020), Mtshali (2020), and Rubin et al. (2020). Research into the causes can help fight this tendency.2 Black and Latino/Hispanic Americans are much more likely to have no insurance; see Berchick et al. (2019) and Centers for Disease Control (2020). Timothy Freeman, pastor at Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Washington DC, calls insurance coverage crucial for COVID disparities: “I have seen diagnostic tests not performed ... and hospitalizations cut extremely short – or not happen at all – because of insurance” (quoted in Johnson 2020).3 Desmet and Wacziarg (2020) find a strong relationship between COVID-19 cases and two measures of county density. However, Emeruwa et al. (2020) study every woman admitted for labour and delivery at two New York hospitals between 22 March and 21 April, all of whom were tested for COVID-19, and find the strongest predictor of COVID-positivity to be residence in a neighbourhood with many people per dwelling, and not people per square mile.4 Wiemers et al. (2020) use pre-pandemic retrospective questions from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics to identify socioeconomic correlates of factors that have turned out to be dangerous comorbidities for COVID-19. Several of these comorbidities are strongly correlated with race, education, and income.5 These factors are emphasised by Mtshali (2020). Hall et al. (2015) survey studies that demonstrate implicit bias in healthcare providers and find some effect on healthcare outcomes. Hoffman et al. (2016) report evidence that a substantial fraction of health professionals undervalue the pain experienced by African-American patients due to racial attitudes, and there are claims that African Americans who have had adverse experiences with healthcare professionals have trouble trusting them and so are slower to seek treatment (Johnson 2020).6 See United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice (1987) for both the origin of the term and the pioneering demonstration of the finding that policy had resulted in toxic environments for racial minorities.7 Wu et al. (2020) show in county data that a high rate of particulate matter in the air, produced by a wide range of industrial facilities, is a powerful predictor of COVID-19 mortality rates after controlling for numerous variables.8 For example, one control variable is the county share of the workforce employed in the Department of Labor’s Occupational Category 31: Healthcare Support Occupations, which includes occupations such as Home Health Aides, Nursing Assistants, and Orderlies. This variable is strongly correlated with COVID-19 deaths.9 Wu et al. (2020) find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the Black population share is associated with a 45% increase in deaths, controlling for particulate matter and other county characteristics. The Hispanic/Latino share is also controlled for but is statistically insignificant.aA

I’m Edward Fitzpatrick and I wouldn’t mind hearing Brown University graduate Andrew Yang speak at the Democratic National Convention. Follow me on Twitter @FitzProv or send tips to Edward.Fitzpatrick@globe.com.ICYMI: Rhode Island was up to 20,053 positive tests as of Tuesday, after adding 99 more confirmed cases. The most recent test-positive rate was 2.5 percent. The state announced one more death, bringing the total to 1,016. There were 88 people in the hospital, nine in intensive care, and two were on ventilators.AdvertisementPublic health experts in Rhode Island say the level of vitriol directed at public health officials across the country is reaching unprecedented levels amid the pandemic.Dr. Anthony Fauci’s family has received threats. California’s public health director, Dr. Sonia Angell, was just ousted. And a review by KHN and The Associated Press finds at least 49 state and local public health leaders have resigned, retired, or been fired since April in 23 states.“I wouldn’t say I’m surprised, knowing both personally and systematically the level of vitriol and hatred targeted at scientists and public health professionals, but I am saddened,” said Dr. Megan L. Ranney, a Brown University associate professor of emergency medicine.Rhode Island is fortunate to have “an executive branch and a Department of Health that are in sync,” Ranney said. Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott have spoken together at numerous news conferences during the pandemic.But she said the nation is seeing too much hatred directed at public health officials who are trying their best to protect people from a deadly virus.AdvertisementWhile any public official can expect to be questioned or criticized, she said some critics need to “take a deep breath,” Ranney said. “Don’t necessarily believe the conspiracy narratives that are being spun. If you speak out, do so with respect.”Marybeth MacPhee, a public health professor at Roger Williams University, said public health officials are dealing with high expectations and insufficient resources, and they can get castigated for asking people to take simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.“It’s like the economy and public health are at war, and the people on the front lines — the public face of public health — are taking the brunt of that antagonism,” she said.MacPhee urged people to remember that everyone is responsible for public health, not just public health officials. “It has to come down to every person being part of the solution,” she said. “That is the best way to get the economy back, the best way to get back to school.”THE GLOBE IN RHODE ISLAND⚓ Governor Gina M. Raimondo will announce during Wednesday’s news conference that she “will likely” delay the start of the school year by a couple of weeks.⚓ Attorney General Peter F. Neronha’s office on Tuesday filed notice that it will seek a harsher sentence under the state’s hate crimes sentencing act for a Barrington man accused of assaulting his neighbor while spewing racial slurs. At a rally in Barrington on Tuesday, Black Lives Matter Rhode Island organizer Mark Fisher said, “A hate crime is a hate crime.”Advertisement⚓ The governors of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey have lifted their orders that travelers from Rhode Island must self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in their states, removing the Ocean State from the tri-state list of locales with relatively high rates of COVID-19 infections.⚓ In a thinly disguised zinger aimed at Joe Biden’s support for abortion rights, Bishop Thomas J. Tobin of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence tweeted: “Biden-Harris. First time in awhile that the Democratic ticket hasn’t had a Catholic on it. Sad.” Actually, Biden is the fourth Catholic major-party presidential nominee in U.S. history, following John Kerry in 2004, John F. Kennedy in 1960, and New York Governor Al Smith, the Democratic nominee in 1928. Tim Kaine, who was Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016, is Catholic.⚓ A piping plover chick taken by vacationers from a Rhode Island beach died at a wildlife center on Cape Cod, despite efforts to save it.MORE ON BOSTONGLOBE.COM⚓ Politics: James Pindell writes that the reason Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris is clear: “her lack of political ideology combined with her killer political instinct and high-wattage charisma.”⚓ Sports/Labor: New England Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower tried to inspire his fiancée, Morgan Hart, while she was in her 17th hour of labor by chanting, “28-3, 28-3” -- the score of Super Bowl LI, in which the Patriots came back to win after trailing the Atlanta Falcons 28-3.

0,Why Scientists Are Wary of the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization of Plasma for Covid-19,https://gizmodo.com/why-scientists-are-wary-of-the-fdas-emergency-use-autho-1844831125,"On Sunday evening, President Donald Trump announced news that his administration had earlier advertised as a “breakthrough” development in the ongoing pandemic: The Food and Drug Administration would issue an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma donated from covid-19 survivors as a treatment for hospitalized covid-19 patients. But though scientists and doctors are genuinely hopeful that convalescent plasma may help patients, some experts are perturbed by how and why the administration made this move.Convalescent plasma has a long history in medicine. People who survive an infectious disease such as covid-19 tend to produce antibodies against the specific germ that caused the disease; these antibodies are readily found in the yellow, liquid part of blood called plasma. By taking a survivor’s plasma and giving it to someone else still battling their infection, the theory goes, you can give that person a form of passive immunity that should temporarily boost their defenses against the disease (“convalescent” simply refers to someone who is recovering from a disease).Doctors have used convalescent plasma since the late 19th century, and it’s been routinely deployed as a hopeful treatment during outbreaks of difficult-to-treat diseases, such as Ebola. Early on in the covid-19 pandemic, doctors were similarly optimistic that convalescent plasma could be  a treatment for this viral disease as well.On the surface, it’s understandable why the FDA has decided to issue an EUA for convalescent plasma. As former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb has noted, an EUA should be used to expand access to a potentially useful experimental treatment in an emergency situation. And in the case of convalescent plasma, there is some evidence already available suggesting that it can lessen the severity of covid-19 or shorten the length of symptoms, though Gottlieb called for further evidence to support its use.But experts and doctors in the field are worried about the political process surrounding this particular emergency authorization.“There is no clear indication that convalescent plasma is effective, and it is not clear what the decision by the FDA is based on,” Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician and assistant professor at Stanford University, said in an email. “There is not a good [randomized controlled trial] to show that convalescent plasma is effective for covid-19, and we should be making decisions based in science.”Last week, the New York Times reported that Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, and Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, were among the experts who vetoed the FDA’s initial decision to issue an EUA for convalescent plasma, citing the lack of strong evidence for its benefits, particularly from randomized controlled clinical trials. Reporting later emerged that Trump administration official Peter Navarro had recently pressured the FDA to speed up its research of covid-19 treatments, accusing agency officials of being part of the “deep state.” During the week, Trump himself criticized the agency for its hesitation in issuing an EUA for plasma.The thing is, patients with covid-19 were already getting convalescent plasma through the Mayo Clinic’s expanded access program and other similar efforts. In these programs, patients were first screened for eligibility through an established protocol, and their outcomes were tracked. But an EUA means that any doctor can prescribe the treatment at their discretion, without needing to document what happens afterward for an analysis later. (On Sunday, the Mayo Clinic announced that it would discontinue enrollment into the program in light of the FDA’s announcement.)The EUA should make it easier for more patients to get ahold of plasma, but according to Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Francisco, the wide-scale rollout of convalescent plasma could also make it harder for doctors to recruit people into the large clinical trials that are needed to figure out if it actually works, since patients might not want to roll the dice and be enrolled into a control group. The extra demand will also probably put a strain on the limited supply of convalescent plasma.“It just sends the message that, ‘Okay, everyone, there’s enough evidence, let’s just go out and use it. Let’s open the floodgates so everybody can use it.’ So I think that’s really why people are concerned,” Chin-Hong said.In announcing the decision, Trump stated that plasma was “proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent.” FDA chief Stephen Hahn seemingly tried to walk back that comment, though he still implied that plasma could be shown to provide a 35% improvement in survival eventually. But there’s simply no research available right now that suggests this to be true.It’s possible that Trump flubbed the interpretation of preliminary data from the Mayo Clinic, which found a difference in survival between hospitalized patients who got plasma three days into diagnosis and those who received plasma four or more days later (8.7% of those who got plasma within three days died in a week’s time, compared to 11.9% of those who got it later). But as experts have pointed out, this comparison was only between patients who received plasma, and it doesn’t provide solid evidence that plasma is an effective treatment.Meanwhile, there is some evidence from small trials suggesting that plasma may not be all that useful for covid-19, and it hasn’t always worked out as an emergency remedy during past disease outbreaks. During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for instance, plasma actually failed to provide any life-saving benefit. Even experts like Chin-Hong, who has prescribed convalescent plasma to covid-19 patients, wouldn’t consider it to be the sort of “breakthrough” that merits a grand reveal by Trump and the FDA.“I mean, who makes a press release on a Sunday about convalescent plasma? It’s not like it’s a new miraculous story,” Chin-Hong said.There are ongoing clinical trials of convalescent plasma in the U.S. and elsewhere. It’s still possible and even likely that plasma will turn out to help covid-19 patients, particularly if it’s given early and taken from donors with high levels of antibodies. But Chin-Hong and other scientists watching from the outside are alarmed about what this chain of events may mean for future developments in covid-19 research, particularly for a potential vaccine.“I suspect the reasons behind the EUA for plasma treatment may have an ulterior motive: They are working to lower the bar for EUAs in general, in order to push what they really want—an EUA for a covid-19 vaccine,” said Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Hotez and his team are currently working to develop a coronavirus vaccine.Though Hotez is encouraged by the research on convalescent plasma and said he would gladly take it if he became sick with covid-19, he’s one of many experts who have become wary of the Trump administration’s messaging on a vaccine, particularly Trump’s stated desire to have one available before election day. Just this past weekend, it was reported that Trump has directed his administration to find a workaround of the clinical trial process that’s needed for regulatory approval of any vaccine or drug in the U.S., possibly by using vaccines being developed elsewhere in Europe.A vaccine for the coronavirus that causes covid-19 appears to be our best strategy to ending the…If the mess surrounding convalescent plasma is a preview of what may come this October for a potential vaccine, it’s a decision that’s likely to further erode public trust in science, experts have warned.“It’s just so awful the way the White House confuses the real science with the fake science for their hidden agendas. But that’s the lesson: This is how anti-science movements work, they string real facts with falsehoods to create false narratives,” Hotez said. Science writer at Gizmodo and pug aficionado elsewhereIf this pandemic has taught me anything, it is that doctors and nurses can be just as easily swept up by bad information that aligns with their political, religious, or just idiot beliefs.

0,Virginia continues to grapple with testing delays as public officials seek workarounds,https://richmond.com/news/virginia/virginia-continues-to-grapple-with-testing-delays-as-public-officials-seek-workarounds/article_099e6bb0-da50-576f-905e-ebe7bf8030b9.html,"Becky Patterson, left and Monica Moore performed COVID-19 testing March 31 at BetterMed Urgent Care on North Parham Road in Henrico County.Celeste Kelly says she had to wait 17 days to receive her COVID-19 test results, which were negative.As public activity steadily rises and the bustling fall season nears for schools and businesses, lengthy waits for COVID-19 testing continue to plague Virginia.National backlogs for COVID-19 test results have for weeks resulted in waits of 10 days or longer for many Virginians, state health experts acknowledge, straining government efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus by tracing known cases, and frustrating efforts by individuals and businesses to follow safety guidelines.The source of the delays for publicly available testing rests with shortages at national labs, but health officials in Virginia are pursuing workarounds to abate the impact of the delays. They include a new multistate agreement to negotiate the purchase of quicker tests, guidance to labs to batch tests for low-risk groups and a new app to help notify people who may have been exposed to the virus.“Delays continue. Things have improved a little bit in the last few days, particularly at hospitals and public health settings,” said Dr. Parham Jaberi, who is leading the state’s COVID-19 testing task force. “From our data, it’s still the turnaround time in the commercial sector. Because the state doesn’t have control over those, we do what we can.”The state’s workarounds could take weeks to take root. For now, individuals and businesses in Virginia continue to feel the strain.17-day waitCeleste Kelly waited 17 days from the time she was swabbed to receive the results of her COVID-19 test.Kelly, who was negative, promptly sought testing for the virus after a friend undergoing major surgery asked Kelly to be by her side. The surgery, scheduled promptly, was six days away.“I immediately logged on and scheduled a COVID test with a CVS Minute Clinic in the Short Pump area. I was able to get a test that day — it was a half-hour away, but I was able to get it the same day,” said Kelly, 26.She was tested on July 15 and was told she would get the results in six to 10 days.Given that Kelly was young, healthy and without symptoms, her sample was likely among those ranked in the lowest priority category, according to state and federal guidelines, which clinics and national labs say they are largely following.Fifteen days later, staff at the clinic where Kelly was tested could not share any information about her results, or how much longer she would need to wait.“At that point, the wait had been longer than the time you’re asked to quarantine,” said Kelly, who had been isolating as a precaution and supporting her ailing friend from a distance during a critical recovery time. “I talked to my friend, and she said, ‘Just come. I need you to come.’ ”Businesses, tooThe stakes, while different, are high for businesses, too.When Lee Gregory’s Church Hill restaurant, Alewife, reopened for in-person dining in June, it found a precarious situation.With cases rising slowly in Richmond, Gregory discovered that when an employee feared a possible exposure to the virus outside of work, or a diner later tested positive, it proved impossible to quickly test the entire staff as a precaution.Without the certainty of a healthy staff, Gregory said he faced a daily moral quandary about whether to open his dining room. If the restaurant closed to test everyone, it could be a week or more before results returned. In an effort to minimize exposure, Alewife announced July 20 it would return to takeout service only.“For us specifically, that was a big part of our decision to close back down,” Gregory said. “We shut back down to try to lessen some of the impact of the virus, but also because you can’t get tested or get a test back on time.”Gregory said he is looking forward to a time when quick testing allows his business to operate on firmer ground in challenging times. If an employee did turn up positive, the restaurant still might have to close due to a shortage of hands, but if not, it could operate with more certainty.“A quicker turnaround time, good Lord, at least would let you sleep at night,” he said. “It would make your decision a lot easier from a health standpoint.”Priority groupsThe Virginia Department of Health acknowledged delays in a letter to physicians on July 13, urging them to “ensure testing of priority groups,” according to the agency’s guidance.The agency has so far declined to issue public guidance asking people to forgo testing if they do not fall into a high-risk group or have symptoms — a measure that would be reminiscent of the early days of the pandemic.Jaberi, the COVID-19 testing task force leader, said the state has not ruled out the measure but that its usefulness would be limited without a concerted national strategy, since many of the labs facing backlogs serve multiple states at once.Jaberi said prioritization at the hospital level, where wait times had gone from a single day to three days in mid-July, has been a successful strategy to help correct the testing delays.He said that based on conversations with hospital executives, hospitals have begun to prioritize testing for high-risk patients and those who are expected to interact with others, such as people staying overnight.“As testing delays were becoming longer, individuals were presenting to the emergency room for testing, when the best place may have been an outpatient setting,” Jaberi said.Turnaround times for Virginians who are presenting mild symptoms, have traveled from a high-risk area or are simply looking for peace of mind remain elevated.Jaberi said the average has improved from six days to four. He said that number suggests that while high-priority patients may be waiting two to three days, “that may mean someone on the other end is going to take 10 days.”Jaberi cited a study out of the Netherlands that found testing delays beyond three days drastically reduce containment of the virus, with few returns past five days.“If you’re waiting 14 days, I don’t think it’s completely useless, but it’s a diminishing return,” he said.‘Cornerstone’ vs. realityJaberi acknowledged that urging the broad public to seek testing as a containment strategy is butting heads with the reality on the ground.People “may not be able to afford to stay home and miss work without knowing the results of their test,” he said.The issue, Jaberi said, is part of ongoing conversations among members of the state’s testing task force, which includes government officials, hospital executives and representatives from major labs.“We’re trying to pose that question,” he said. “For now, the public health message is, you should get tested. That’s the cornerstone.”Jaberi said members of the testing task force and the state’s top officials, including Gov. Ralph Northam and Health Commissioner Norman Oliver, have begun promoting the idea of pool testing — a process newly approved by the federal government that allows for labs to test several samples at once, and perform individual tests if the pool test comes back positive.“Every lab knows their technical limitations. ... We’re definitely looking at this as a viable means to ... decrease the delay and turnaround times,” he said.Six-state compactVirginia health officials are also pursuing a new type of COVID-19 test as a workaround to lengthy wait times for traditional diagnostic COVID-19 tests.The state has joined a six-state compact in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation that will negotiate with two private testing companies to purchase 500,000 antigen tests for Virginia. The firms developing the tests are Becton, Dickinson and Co. of New Jersey and California-based Quidel.Antigen tests can deliver results within 15 minutes of a sample being inserted into the processing machine. But they tend to be less reliable than other tests.“That is the one major drawback when compared to some of the other molecular tests with higher sensitivity,” Jaberi said.Still, he said state officials see the speed as a critical asset in the current landscape, and more so as back-to-school season approaches and offices amp up work after the slower summer months. It could also help the state’s contact tracing program, which tracks the known contacts of a positive case and alerts people potentially exposed.Marshall Vogt, who is leading the tracing program, said ongoing delays mean that by the time the state reaches a known positive case, or any of their contacts, it may have been two weeks or longer. That can diminish the effectiveness of the program.“What is really turning our attention to antigen testing is getting the result very quickly. The benefit for a workplace or a school setting is knowing immediately who is positive, and quickly isolating,” Vogt said.“While it may not be as accurate as a [diagnostic test], that advantage may outweigh the fact that they are not as sensitive.”Asked on Wednesday, Northam could not say when Virginia would begin receiving its 500,000 tests. Jaberi said negotiations are ongoing, and no final deal has been reached. Once that happens, the state’s testing task force will begin discussing how to best distribute the new resource.“This is more an announcement to let our Virginians know we’re working on this problem,” Jaberi said. “They want to know what we’re doing about delayed turnaround times, and this is just another strategy we’re pursuing.”mleonor@timesdispatch.com(804) 649-6254Twitter: @MelLeonor_Dr. Danny Avula: testing and vaccine on COVID-19 Get all the latest local and national COVID-19 coverage and more for just $3 for the first 3 months.

    First Lady Melania Trump speaks at the second night of the 2020 Republican National Convention.It is a telling measure of our mean-spirited culture that the first lady of the United States has been mocked and vilified for daring to redesign the Rose Garden.Whether the design is pleasing or not, it was clear that the media would not be giving Melania Trump the Jill Biden treatment when she spoke to the Republican convention.She has been the least public first lady in decades, and English is not her native language, but the principal sin of this elegant former fashion model is that she’s married to...him. In the runup to Tuesday night’s appearance, journalists kept bringing up her 2016 address, in which a mishap caused her staff to plagiarize some passages from an old Michelle Obama speech.POMPEO BREAKS DIPLOMATIC TRADITION WITH CONVENTION SPEECH, TOUTS TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY AGENDABefore a small audience in the revamped garden, Melania Trump did what virtually no other speaker had: acknowledge the impact of the coronavirus and express sympathy for its victims.Since March, she said, “our lives have changed drastically” because of “the invisible enemy.” She offered sympathy and prayers for those who have lost a loved one or are suffering, and said “Donald will not rest” until an effective treatment is found. That was no small thing at a convention that talked about the pandemic in the past tense, when it was talked about at all. It wasn’t just cheerleading. And she declined to use her time “to attack the other side.”While not a natural orator, the first lady said she was humbled by coming here from a communist country and living the American dream. Despite “negative or false media headlines,” she said, the president won’t lose focus on helping the country. She also talked about Africa, drug addiction, violence and motherhood. It was, in short, a plain-spoken and compassionate talk.While some pundits on Twitter credited Melania with speaking frankly about the virus, others questioned what she sees in her husband, ridiculed her outfit or laughed at her delivery. One called it “a Seinfeld speech...about nothing.”It was left to New York Times columnist David Brooks to scold: “Stop scoffing. Melania’s speech is at least relatively decent and humane.” Even fierce Republican Trump critic Mike Murphy called it “the only high-ground presidential speech you will ever hear at this convention.”TRUMP HIGHLIGHTS LEGAL IMMIGRATION, OVERSEES NATURALIZATION CEREMONY DURING RNCHer words even won over some of the TV pundits, from CNN’s Dana Bash to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, who said “that’s the first time in two days we have had even a straightforward expression of sympathy.” Fox’s Dana Perino said “she lights up the room.” But Joy Reid complained about using the White House as a backdrop.Tuesday’s proceedings, heavy on family members (including Eric and Tiffany), was low on celebrity wattage. The party trotted out plenty of average citizens, from a Wisconsin dairy farmer to a Maine lobsterman, who like Trump. It was a lower-key evening that sought to soften the GOP’s image and strengthen its connection to small business owners, with remarkably little mention of the coronavirus or the 30 million unemployed. In fact, Larry Kudlow essentially talked about the pandemic in the past tense.The first night of the virtual GOP show drew about 16 million TV viewers, compared to 19 million for the Democrats’ first night. The number was about 30 percent lower than four years ago, similar to the Dem dropoff. And nearly half of the live audience (7 million) watched on Fox News, compared with MSNBC as the ratings leader for the Democrats--suggesting these convention programs have little cross-party appeal.Trump did pull off two convention firsts--by pardoning Jon Ponder, a reformed ex-convict who now helps other prisoners, and the other at a naturalization ceremony for legal immigrants. These were smart political moves, even if they were stunts, and underscore the power of incumbency to act rather than just talk.When former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi went off on Hunter Biden and accused the family of profiteering in China, it was a double-edged sword. The liberal ladies at MSNBC, aided by a former FBI official, rushed in to remind viewers that Trump was impeached on grounds of pressuring Ukraine to cough up dirt on the Bidens--the battle royale that went unmentioned at the Democratic convention.BONDI ON BIDEN’S POLITICAL CAREER: ‘THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFITED ARE HIS FAMILY MEMBERS, NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE’Similarly, MSNBC brought on another ex-prosecutor after Eric Trump’s speech to explain that he’s been asked to testify in a probe of the family real estate firm by the New York attorney general. CNN challenged some of his questionable statements, such as peace in the Middle East (a reference to the recent agreement between Israel and the UAE).The convention had its share of side controversies. One speaker was pulled at the last minute after the Daily Beast reported on a stunningly anti-Semitic tweet. And Mike Pompeo’s short speech from Jerusalem is drawing sharp criticism--and a House probe--as he became the first secretary of State to address a presidential convention. Pompeo hailed the boss’ foreign policy record and included North Korea, although the engagement with Kim Jong-un has produced no agreements.While there was somewhat less Biden-bashing on Tuesday night--though there were false claims that he’s for open borders and total amnesty--what’s striking about both conventions is the overall level of apocalyptic rhetoric.To hear the Democrats tell it, a Trump reelection would mean a death knell for democracy, an uncontrolled pandemic, heartless immigration policy and endless corruption. To hear the Republicans tell it, a Biden victory would mean more urban riots, a ban on private health insurance, the elimination of fossil fuels and the end of free speech.And yet most of the media don’t blink at the more extreme attacks on Trump because they basically buy into that rhetoric.One thing the president’s defenders haven’t quite figured out: if racial unrest, big-city violence, health care problems and a shattered economy are threatening to ruin America, why hasn’t Trump been able to stop those things? He is a president running as an outside insurgent. The best they’ve been able to do is that Trump made America great--before the “China virus” undid much of the progress--and he can do it again.The next two nights will show whether Melania Trump’s speech was just a brief respite.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!
